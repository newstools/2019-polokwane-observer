Learners in Grades 10 and 11 reportedly had to write two different Life Orientation papers on Friday after it was alleged that the first question papers were leaked.
Although it is not yet known as to how many schools were affected, one principal in the Pietersburg circuit voiced his frustration as he mentioned that learners had to be stopped halfway through the exam after the circuit manager had informed them that the paper had been leaked. He further stated that learners had to wait for at least 20 minutes for new question papers.
“This inconvenienced our learners and I was also frustrated as the head of the school. Learners invest a lot of their time to prepare for the exams hence such incidents affect them negatively. The alleged leakage also costs us a lot of money because we had to print over 4 293 question papers twice. This is just not fair,” principal stressed.
He reckoned that it was necessary for the Department of Education to change its examination system for Grades 10 and 11 and reiterated that question papers for the aforementioned grades should be delivered to schools on the day of the exam as they do with matric papers.
Comments from Department of Education Spokesperson Sam Makondo was still awaited at the time of publishing the story on the website while Provincial Police Spokesperson, Moatshe Ngoepe could not be reached on his cell phone and Police Provincial Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo was, due to poor signal at his then location, unable to engage in a telephonic conversation with Polokwane Observer.
