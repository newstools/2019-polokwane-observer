Mrs Polokwane finalist Mapula Legodi met with officials at the Department of Social Development to talk about her upcoming Family Fun Day fundraising event planned for Saturday at Mitchell House.
The day will be used to create awareness about gender-based violence, human trafficking and instilling confidence in children. Legodi indicated that the event was set to commence at 9:00 and that entrance would be free. She said that any kind of donation would be gladly accepted in aid of Ekuphumleni Restoration Home – ThyRest in Seshego. ThyRest is a shelter for women from all socio-economic backgrounds who have been victims of sexual abuse, rape, human trafficking and sex workers who want out.
Legodi added that the shelter was founded to assist victims with healing and restoration to enable them to utilise their painful experiences to regain control of their lives and rid themselves of feelings and unhelpful behaviour that was caused by the trauma. They are currently on a mission to construct an administration block so any donation of building material would be highly appreciated, Legodi explained.
Departmental Spokesperson Witness Tiva emphasised that the Department of Social Development welcomes Legodi’s initiative as it will go a long way in addressing the social ills that are happening in some parts of the province. Legodi was invited to deliver a motivational talk at Dikolobe Primary School in Mankweng during the Grade 7 farewell function scheduled for tomorrow (Friday).
