Polokwane Municipality Fire and Safety Unit personnel attempt to extinguish fire after a large number of truck tyres on land owned by a private company in Ivy Park Ext 22 caught fire yesterday (Wednesday). Out of curiosity, residents flocked to the scene opposite Laerskool Ivy Park to investigate. When Polokwane Observer arrived at the scene none of the bystanders, including employees of the company, knew the cause of the fire.
