After nearly a year on the run from charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and rape a suspect was arrested by Police in Groblersdal last week and is expected to make his second appearance in the local magistrate’s court on Monday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that Charles Motswathupa (34) appeared in court earlier this week facing charges of kidnapping, rape and murder. The case was postponed to Monday for further Police investigation and a bail application.
The case follows an incident in December last year when the body of Samson Sithole (2) was found among vegetation near Koteng village outside Marble Hall. Motswathupa was receiving medical treatment following an alleged mob justice incident during which he was the victim.
Communities reportedly accused him of attempted murder, kidnapping and rape of a seven-year-old girl between the 30 September and 1 October in the Nebo policing area and subsequently attacked and assaulted.
He will appear in the Nebo Magistrate’s Court in connection with this matter.
