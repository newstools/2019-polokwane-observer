Field workers of Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) are accompanied on a visit to the Mankweng area today (Monday) by Calvin Molongoana, Statistician General of South Africa, Stats SA Census Project Director, Risenga Maluleke and Stats SA Provincial Head, Nthambeleni Mukwevho.
The exercise is in preparation for the population count, Census 2021 and the field workers will for the first time use digital devices to collect data during this trial run. The trial run will be followed by an independent survey called the Post Enumeration Survey from 14 November until 13 December this year.
Data collected in a census is used by government and other sectors of society for planning and decision making, including the implementation of the Division of Revenue Act.
The dayâ€™s programme will culminate in the handover of computer equipment to Maphefo Primary School.
