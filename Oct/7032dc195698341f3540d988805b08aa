The road between Hospital and Landdros Maré streets is currently closed as Police and emergency personnel are investigating an alleged bomb threat at the South African Broadcasting Corporation’s (SABC) offices earlier this morning (Friday).
The street has been cordoned off by Police and traffic officials while the fire brigade and Police’s bomb squad are active closer to the building.
The building has been evacuated and according to some of the staff it seems to be a drill, but according to a source it might be a serious situation. It is alleged that a brown box was found on the premises but it didn’t contain any explosives.
Neither Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe nor Polokwane Municipality’s Communications Manager Matshidiso Mothapo were aware of the situation. In addition no one in the SABC’s communications department could be reached.
