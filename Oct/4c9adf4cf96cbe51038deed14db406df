Officials from five government departments in the city were unable to continue with work this morning (Friday) after Polokwane Municipality terminated electricity supply to their offices yesterday (Thursday) afternoon.
The municipality’s debt book is currently more than R1 billion with 14 government departments and state entities responsible for R144 million of this amount.
Before embarking on the cut-off operation with members of the municipality’s Finance Portfolio Committee, Member of the Mayoral Committee Charles Molepo said to the media that despite several pleas and notices as well as engagements with Chief Finance Officers of the departments, the provincial departments of Rural Development, Public Works, Education and Health as well as the national Department of Public Works owed the municipality more than R53,1 million, R50,9 million, R9,7 million, R4,4 million and R16,4 million respectively, being the top defaulters.
Molepo said that Polokwane Municipality is a caring local authority and ensured that schools and hospitals were not affected by the intervention.
