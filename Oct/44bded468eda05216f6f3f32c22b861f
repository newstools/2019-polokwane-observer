After losing her father to cancer two years ago, Mrs Polokwane finalist Modjadji Baloyi took a firm decision that she would educate people on how to lower cancer risks and also host charity events to raise money to assist children infected with the disease.
Baloyi hosted her first cancer awareness charity event at Capricorn College for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (Tvet) in support of Cansa Polokwane on Saturday. She emphasised that the event was aimed at raising funds through ticket sales and at the same time educating people about the dangers on cancer. Although Baloyi could not disclose the amount raised on the day, she indicated that the money collected would be donated to Cansa Polokwane in due course.
Baloyi further highlighted that although the Mrs Polokwane beauty pageant was not about prizes but assisting the less fortunate, she was confident that she would be crowned the winner at the final round planned for 30 November at Bolivia Estate.
“When my father was diagnosed with cancer in 2016 I didn’t have much knowledge about the disease. We didn’t know which food and medication was good for him. After he lost the battle to cancer the following year, I told myself that I would look for links that would make it possible for me to work closely with cancer patients hence I joined Mrs Polokwane beauty contest,” Baloyi explained.
The gathering was addressed by cancer survivors and medical professionals who gave an overview of cancer. Baloyi indicated that the event was a major success and thanked everyone who made it possible.
