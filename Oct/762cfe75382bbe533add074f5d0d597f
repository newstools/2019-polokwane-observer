More than 40 aspirant male models are in the running for the Mr Limpopo 2020 title which will be presented along with Miss Limpopo title on 7 December at a venue in Polokwane.
Event organiser Matlakala Bopape said the winner will walk away with a R10 000 cash prize, a sea cruise to Portuegese Island off the Mozambican coast as well as a R10 000 spa voucher.
“This is the maiden pageant and we want it to be a success. From this pageant we are looking for a male voice, someone who will talk to young men about gender-based violence and social ills. We want someone who will be a role model for young men,” Bopape said before adding that all the hopefuls will undergo a workshop which entails educational and social programmes before the final event.
