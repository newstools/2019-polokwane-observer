Following a successful Lovers’ Ball charity event that was hosted under the theme ‘Why do we get married’ at the Roman Catholic Church in Seshego recently, Mrs Polokwane 2020 finalists Sibongile Maja and Mimie Moselenyane extended a helping hand to Ikageng Drop-In Centre and Home based Care by donating different goods to children and caregivers on Saturday.
The ball night made it possible for the duo to raise R5 300 and they donated colouring books, crayons, powder paint, paint brushes, project paper, glue, safety gloves and safety musks, clothes and had installed a Wi-fi that was sponsored by a certain company. Maja highlighted that the wi-fi comes with a 12-months contract to the tune of R13 500 and reiterated that it will help children with their homework.
“We chose the centre after learning from the Department of Social Development that children catered for at the institution struggle due to a lack of sponsors. The safety gloves and masks will come in handy when caregivers visit patients. We are also on a mission to collect food parcels that will be donated to children at the same centre for the festive holidays. Our next charity event is planned for 9 November at a shopping complex in Ivy Park. We are intending to host aerobics and other fitness activities,” Maja explained.
She further stated that they were delighted to see smiles on children’s faces as she mentioned that they will do anything in their power to reach out to the less fortunate.
