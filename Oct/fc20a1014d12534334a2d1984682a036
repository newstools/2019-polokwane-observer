Motivated by her concern for young boys and their need for guidance and grooming to become better men, Mrs Polokwane finalist Maggie Matloa successfully hosted a picnic lunch and talk for boys at Seshego Beach Front on Saturday.
The gathering was to afford boys an opportunity to unleash their hidden potential. Girls and mothers of participants were also part of the session to support the boys. The chill out session was a platform to get to know their dreams, fears and challenges.
Matloa indicated that girls have a role to play in cheering the boys and ensuring the well-being of their brothers.
She further stated that they discovered that the issue of impressing girls was one of the challenges as raised by boys. Matloa encouraged girls to support the boys at home and otherwise.
“Mothers in attendance emphasised that when we shape the lives of a boy child we are securing the lives of our girls and working towards restoring the boys’ confidence by supporting them. When we teach boys self-love we are helping them to realise their responsibilities and therefore they shall assume their roles of protecting their sisters and women,” Matloa explained.
According to her, the session was a success and it had a great impact on everyone at the venue. She further revealed that attendees requested that such sessions be hosted often to boost boy children’s confidence. She reiterated that each of the more than 30 boys in attendance received three antiperspirant roll-ons, soap and bathing cloths.
She added that another event of this nature was planned for later in the year and would target boys in rural communities such as Ga-Chuene and Ga-Mamabolo. Matloa thanked attendees for making the event a success and motivational speakers for being spot on in their respective presentations.
