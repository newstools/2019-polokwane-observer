Their fifth defeat of Premier Soccer League (PSL), this time at the hands of Amazulu Football Club at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday, has left Baroka desperate to bring down the mighty Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club.
The two clubs will meet in the tenth match of the PSL set for Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday.
Baroka is lying precociously in the 14th position of the league and is in desperate need of points while Sundowns is looking to consolidate their second position of the log.
Head coach of the club, Wedson Nyirenda said after the Amazulu match that they could have won the duel but they could not convert the chances they created.
“I must admit it was the first time I lost four consecutive matches as a coach. However, we are playing well, we have a good squad. We are unable to get the desired results but we will keep on fighting.”
He described the Sundowns assignment as difficult but achievable. “They are tough and difficult opponents. They are the reigning champions of the league, a different team but with such matches there is no need to motivate the players.
“It is a big game and we stand good chance of winning it,” Nyirenda remarked.
