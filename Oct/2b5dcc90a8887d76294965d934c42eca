Seventeen beauties (17) who have entered the semi-final round of the 2020 Miss Limpopo pageant will be subjected to final interviews of the pageant set to take place in Polokwane on Sunday.
The contestants were chosen out of 500 hopefuls who entered the competition that ran from May until September.
Event organiser, Matlakala Bopape said from the 17 they are looking for ten girls who will contest for the title at the pageant final on 7 December in Polokwane.
“We are satisfied with the final figure. It was not an easy task trimming the number to a manageable and ideal number. We are pleased with what we got and we wish them good luck for Sunday,” Bopape said.
She said from the final ten they are looking for someone who upholds the traits of a role model.
“We are looking for someone who is involved in community work, a scholar and young woman of integrity,” concluded Bopape.
Zonique Saaiman and Annabel Joubert committee members of Miss Limpopo pageant will cross-examine the hopefuls.
