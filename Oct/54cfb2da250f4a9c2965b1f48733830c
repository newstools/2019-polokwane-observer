Huge appreciation was shown during Polokwane Police’s visit to Bella Vista Old Age Home to celebrate International Day for Elderly Persons last Wednesday.
The initiative of Polokwane Police emphasised that men and women in blue are not only there to fight crime and apprehend criminals but also to show that they care about the elderly and surprise residents with lunch and gifts.
The initiative was led by Polokwane Police Spokesperson Lesiba Ramoshaba in collaboration with members of Social Crime Prevention Unit as well as social workers.
Ramoshaba expressed himself on the vulnerability and general safety of the elderly and urged them not to be afraid to report any incidents at the Police.
Bella Vista Manager Elize Jonker expressed her gratitude towards Polokwane Police. “It was a big surprise when they arrived with lunch and gifts. We received delicious food and cold drinks as well as toiletries. Just having them here and know that they care is a big privilege,” Jonker said.
She indicated that the community can follow in the Police’s footsteps by showing more interest in the well-being of elderly people. “There are so many elderly people who have lost hope in life and have nowhere to go. The elderly are struggling and they need help from communities to feel human again,” she said.
She thanked Polokwane Police for their regular visits to the facility. Jonker said the Polokwane Police visit the home on a regular basis the past year just to check in and to hear if they are encoutering any problems.
