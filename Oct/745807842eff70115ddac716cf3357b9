The 2019 edition of Limpopo Fashion Week that was held at the Polokwane Art Museum on Friday evening was a celebration of body acceptance as 30 models showcased fashionable clothes in front of a large audience.
According to event founder and producer Hlologelo Molokomme, the garments were created by incredible local designers including Tebogo Ratau who allowed each model to come alive with style and colour. The show attracted local and Johannesburg based fashion designers, she explained and reiterated that they have since gained traction from their first year of hosting the event.
“Limpopo Fashion Week is a work in progress which we see the people in the province starting to appreciate as our aim is to promote local and home-grown designers – being that we are a diverse province. The theme was ‘Imagery (out) of Fashion’ which was highlighting how modern and historical fashion with influences of art are being juxtaposed and seeming to extinguish our culture and traditions through new design elements,” Molokomme concluded.
