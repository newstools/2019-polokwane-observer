The wedding of an out-of-town couple ended in a nightmare when their guests were held gunpoint by an armed gang brandishing machine guns on Sunday eve.
Chaos erupted and at least two people were seriously injured in an attempt to escape when the armed suspects allegedly stormed into the Nirvana Community Hall during the wedding ceremony.
It is reported that the suspects were armed with machine guns and robbed the newlyweds’ gift money as well as cell phones, cameras and personal belongings of guests.
No shots were seemingly fired but the robbers’ presence resulted in a stampede as between 250 and 300 guests tried to escape.
Those injured reportedly sustained serious wounds to their hands, legs and buttocks as they climbed over the palisade fence surrounding the premises.
Photographs provided of the venue is evident of the chaos that erupted as food and cutlery were seen lying on the floor and chairs having been knocked over.
The newlyweds are reportedly from Burgersfort and only rented the hall for the reception. Polokwane Observer was not able to connect with the couple as they were already in Ethiopia for their honeymoon.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe did not respond.
