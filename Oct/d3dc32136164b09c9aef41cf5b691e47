The case of attempted murder against Ali Salman, the suspect in the alleged shooting of double murder accused Rameez Patel’s brother Razeen in July last year, was recently provisionally withdrawn.
National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Limpopo Spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi late last week confirmed that the charge against Salman has provisionally been withdrawn on account of the complainant’s unavailability. “The matter will be revisited when he is available,” she said.
Razeen was allegedly shot four times, twice in the head and twice in the arm, on the R71 outside Mankweng a day before he had to testify against his brother who is standing trial in the murder case of his wife Fatima.
Salman was charged with attempted murder after he handed himself over to Police days after the shooting. He was granted R5 000 bail in the Mankweng Regional Court.
