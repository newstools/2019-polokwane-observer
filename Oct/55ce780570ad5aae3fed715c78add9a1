Police are investigating a case of murder after a 12-year-old boy allegedly got access to his father’s firearm and shot his three-year-old brother at Ga-Molepo on Saturday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo said the incident happened at around 08:30 when the teenager got hold of his 53-year-old father’s firearm which he reportedly left in a bag in one of the rooms in their house.
The father is a former security officer and was not home during the incident, according to Mojapelo. He added that the teenager somehow got hold of the gun and it was not yet clear how he managed to shot his brother.
The mother who was at home immediately investigated when she heard the gunshot only to find her youngest badly injured. She rushed him to a local clinic but he was certified dead on arrival,
The Police were informed and the firearm has been seized.
Mojapelo indicated that the suspect would be dealt with in accordance with the processes governing children who are in conflict with the law and that probation officers have already been engaged to take the process forward.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has condemned the incident and directed that in addition to the investigations into the circumstances of the shooting appropriate steps must be taken against the father for keeping the firearm in contravention of the Firearms Control Act. He urged all lawful firearm owners to keep their weapons locked in safes to not only to avoid unauthorised access but to prevent similar incidents from happening.
