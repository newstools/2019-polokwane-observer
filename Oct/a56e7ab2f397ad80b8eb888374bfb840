This year the City of Stars is pulling out all stops with a celebration of Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW) that will be observed from Friday until 18 November at various venues all over the city.
The events will target innovators and job creators and the aim of the activity is to drive economic growth and expand human welfare. It is also a platform for awareness and highlighting of the importance of entrepreneurship as an economic driver and entrepreneurs will have an opportunity to network and connect with potential collaborators and mentors.
The celebrations kick off with the GEW Fashion Show hosted at Nirvana Community Hall on Friday, followed by an Agri-preneurship Seminar at Jack Botes Hall next Tuesday. A Culinary Show and Competition will take place at Limpopo Chefs Academy in Nirvana on 7 November.
A highlight of the celebration will be the Polokwane Star Awards that is scheduled for 14 November at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium and the last two events will be the Limpopo Tourism Holiday Fair at Savannah Mall from 14 to 16 November and the GEW Seminar at Jack Botes Hall on 18 November.
