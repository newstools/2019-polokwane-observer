Ten-year-old Morgan Mayoss recently represented Limpopo at the national u.13 championships hosted by GolfRSA in Stellenbosch.
Limpopo Golf Union operations and development manager Jean Sadie said the talented Laerskool Pietersburg-Oos learner was the only golfer from the province to qualify for the national tournament.
Morgan did exceptionally well as he managed to finish in position 33 out of 82 participants.
That he finished with +21 is, according to Sadie, a great achievement.
Sadie congratulated Morgan and remarked that with his aptitude for the game the potential is there for a bright future.
