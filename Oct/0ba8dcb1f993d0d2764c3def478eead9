Ivydale and Flora and Fauna Park are currently (Tuesday) subjected to unplanned power outages.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo indicated that the municipality is working on restoring power supply to the affected areas.
“In the meantime, all electrical wiring should be treated as live to avoid injury and damage. Polokwane Municipality apologises for the inconvenience caused,” Mothapo said but could not indicate when supply will be restored.
