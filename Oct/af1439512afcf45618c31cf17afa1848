In their quest to stay abreast with other clubs in the Premier Soccer League (PSL), Black Leopards Football Club has appointed former Polokwane City Football Club and Free State Stars Football Club mentor Luc Eymael as their head coach last Friday.
The Belgian takes over from French mentor Lionel Soccoia who was removed from his position last Monday after failing to deliver the desired results in his six matches of the league.
Managing Director of the Club, Tshifiwa Thidiela believes Eymael can help Leopards to win silverware in the league.
“He is capable, we know his history and he knows South African football. Again, when you choose a coach is like when you are choosing a player. You choose these people based on their records and performance and his track record speaks volumes. Polokwane is not foreign to him, he has been following the club and we are hopeful that he will do well,” Thidiela said.
Eymael has won the Nedbank Cup with Free State Stars in 2018 and he holds the (Union of European Football Associations) UEFA Pro Licence which is the highest football coaching qualification.
He received the UEFA Pro Licence in 2007 and the UEFA A Licence which he received on 10 September 2002, from the Royal Belgian Football Association. He is also a graduate from the Federal School of football coaching of Union Royale Belge Des Sociétés de Football Association.
He also holds the Confederation of African Football (CAF) A License which he received from the Tunisian Football Federation on 5 February 2015.
