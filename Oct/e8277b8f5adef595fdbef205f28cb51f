Justice Rhudzani Muvhango, a 34-year-old awaiting trial prisoner who allegedly tried to escape by jumping from the rooftop of Thohoyandou Police holding cells last Monday was rearrested the following day when found crawling around the premises with both legs broken.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Muvhango was facing charges of murder, business robbery, cash-in-transit robbery, malicious damage to property and possession of an unlicensed firearm and will now also face a charge of attempting to escape lawful custody.
Mojapelo said that Muvhango apparently broke his legs when he jumped from the roof. He then informed a Police member who found him on the station premises that he had been knocked down by a speeding vehicle on the adjacent road and that the vehicle had failed to stop after the accident.
He was taken to a local hospital for medical treatment only to be recognised by a Police officer performing guard duty at the facility. He was immediately rearrested and is currently under Police guard in hospital, according to Mojapelo.
He is expected to appear in the local magistrateâ€™s court as soon as he has recovered from his injuries.
