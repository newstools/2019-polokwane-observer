A 63-year old woman from Magona and Gidjana in Malamulele village was allegedly killed by a hippo in the area yesterday.
According to sources the woman was attacked by the hippo in the river close to the area and she reportedly died at a local clinic.
Spokesperson for the Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (Ledet), Zaid Kalla said due to the scarcity of such incidences, the residents tailed the animal fuelled by curiosity and ignorance of the danger attached to such action. “Assuming the hippo felt provoked, threatened and overwhelmed by the need to protect its young, it attacked. Those around managed to swiftly escape while the 63-year-old was unfortunate and fell victim to the animal.”
He stressed that although such incidences are not familiar around the community, the department urges all community members to be vigilant and refrain from approaching stray wild animals whenever spotted. “Authorities should be informed whenever a stray animal is spotted.” Kalla remarked.
He added that Ledet MEC Thabo Mokone has dispatched a team of field rangers to track down the hippo roaming in the area and escort them to a wildlife friendly environment. “As Government our prayers are currently with the family of the deceased and we regret the unfortunate incident,” Kalla said.
