A middle-aged man was expected to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate’s Court earlier this week after he was arrested for being in possession of alleged stolen cell phone network tower batteries worth thousands of Rand.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said that Police received a tip-off about the suspect who allegedly stole batteries from a tower of one of the local service provider’s towers in the area.
Police quickly established a task team consisting of members of the Louis Trichardt Crime Prevention Unit, detectives, and Crime Intelligence Unit with the support of local security companies to trace the suspect.
Ngoepe said the suspect driving a GMW bakkie was quickly cornered within the centre of the town. Twenty batteries, a bolt cutter, grinders, blowtorch and screwdrivers were confiscated during the arrest.
