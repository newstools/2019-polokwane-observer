The Class of 2019 at Capricorn High School (CHS) bade farewell to the school during the annual Valedictory Parade held at the sport field on Saturday.
The parade is one of the school’s oldest traditions and has its purpose to bid the matrics farewell and honour alumni who have passed away.
The Grade 12 guard of honour marched onto the field and the proceeding continued with much pomp and ceremony.
Sagale Sodi, a top 10 learner in Grade 11, paid tribute to the educators and matriculants.
She said it has been a difficult year for the learners and educators and applauded the commitment shown by both parties. “We want to thank them for being our brothers and sisters throughout the years. They have led us well and we thank them for that. May they continue to make the school proud in their next academic chapter,” Sagale said.
Boiki Tsedu, Chairperson of the School Governing Body urged parents to be responsible for their children and play a role in their academic activities. “Parents play a bigger role than educators. They need to make sure that their children observe school rules and they are disciplined at all times.”
He had words of encouragement for the Grade 12s whose national senior certificate exams commenced last Wednesday. “We wish them all the best. We want them to do us proud and follow in the footsteps of other successful learners from the school,” Tsedu said.
Principal Lucas Chuene described the 2019 matric class as one of the biggest and most cooperative groups the school has ever had. “They behaved well and they worked very hard throughout the year. We are confident that they will do well in their exams,” he remarked.
