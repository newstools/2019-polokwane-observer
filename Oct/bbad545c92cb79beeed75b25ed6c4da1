Kagiso Maroga (34) and Dan Tjie (35), suspects in the alleged murder of Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality Councillor Thabang Maupa last year, abandoned their bail application in the Praktiseer Magistrateâ€™s Court on Monday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed their appearance and indicated that the two would remain in custody until their next court appearance on 6 December.
Mojapelo previously indicated that Maupa was killed on 26 November 2018 while seated in his car in front of a business belonging to him and his wife along the R37 at Ribacross in Tubatse. Maupa had arrived at the business before closing time to help his wife lock up for the day.
The couple, having locked up, was seated in their vehicle when unknown suspects on foot allegedly opened fire on them, hitting Maupa several times. He died on the scene and his wife sustained serious bullet wounds, according to Mojapelo. The motive for the killing is still being investigated.
Meanwhile, the reward of R250 000 is still on offer for information that can lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspect(s) responsible for the killing of Mogalakwena councillors Valtyn Kekana and Ralph Kanyane in Mokopane in July.
Mojapelo previously confirmed that Police have received information since and assured that they were following up on all leads received.
