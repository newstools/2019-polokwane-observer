It was all fun and games for learners of PEPPS Preparatory School during the Foundation Phase sport day on Friday.
Grades R, 1, 2 and 3 learners took part in various sporting activities that included bean-bag toss, sack race, wheelbarrow race, swing-ball and mini hurdles. PEPPS communication and marketing officer Millisa Naidoo indicated that these non-competitive activities served the purpose of preparing children for their future sporting interests in the various codes offered at the school.
She added that the sport day was spiced up by parents who joined in on the fun by taking part in activities with their children. It was a fun-filled day that ended with a well-deserved ice-cream for each, Naidoo concluded.
