A tactical intelligence-driven operation performed as part of the Policeâ€™s safer Festive Season initiative across the province, led to the arrest of a 26-year-old suspect and the recovery of four firearms and ammunition at Mokomotji village in the Maake area last Wednesday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Police followed up on information which led them to a house in the area.
He added that Police searched the house and found an AK-47 rifle, two R5 rifles, a pistol, nine rifle magazines and ammunition, two pairs of hand gloves and a Police reflector jacket.
The suspect was arrested on the spot and investigations to determine whether the weapons could have been used in the commission of serious crimes, including cash-in-transit have already begun, according to Mojapelo.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has commended the members who were involved in this operation and has urged all other members to be relentless in ridding the province of illegal firearms.
