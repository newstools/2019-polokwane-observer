A team of Rotarians and Anns of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 recently put their energy together to unload four tons of apples, pears and tomatoes donated by NJ Fresh Produce and Butchery at Our Home/Ons Tuiste before delivering it to 12 institutions caring for people in need around the city.
The organisations receiving the donation were, among others, Vision of Hope, Polo­kwane Nasorgsentrum, Aretha Huis and Jo-Ann Rusoord.
President of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100, Horst Meyer thanked NJ Fresh Produce and Butchery for the donation. “Rotary can only do its work of service to the community if we are supported by the local businesspeople and residents of the city,” Meyer said.
