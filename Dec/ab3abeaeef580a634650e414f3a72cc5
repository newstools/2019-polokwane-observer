Rameez Patel who stands accused of the alleged murder of his wife, Fatima in April 2015 and his mother, Mahejeen in September 2017 in Nirvana shook his head in disbelief when Polo­kwane Magistrate Janine Ungerer informed him on Friday that his application for bail in his mother’s case was denied.
Patel has been applying for bail in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court since October. On Friday, Ungerer once again indicated that she is not ready with her reasons yet, but indicated to Patel that his bail application was denied. She further said that she would give full judgement next week.
His trial in Fatima’s case was expected to continue in the Limpopo High Court yesterday (Tuesday).
Earlier this year the same court postponed the trial in which Patel stands accused of the murder of his mother to March next year.
