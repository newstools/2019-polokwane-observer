Despite the unfavourable economic climate, shoppers still took advantage of the host of special deals and promotions that were offered by many retail outlets in the city on Black Friday.
The opening of shops in Mall of the North on Black Friday was, however, not characterised by stampedes of eager shoppers aiming to be the ones to grab that special item of which stocks were limited. “This year many of the retailers extended their Black Friday promotions beyond Friday, resulting in a more even spread of shoppers even over the weekend,” a retailer explained. Another contributing fact was that some of the shops even opened their doors at midnight to allow shoppers that could not make time for shopping during working hours.
