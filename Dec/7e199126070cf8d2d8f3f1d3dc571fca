Polokwane Municipality’s annual Charity Golf Day saw 104 golfers from 26 teams taking on the challenge of 18 holes in IPS format at the Polokwane Golf Club on Friday.
Polokwane acting Executive Mayor Tshepo Nkwe and former Polokwane Executive Mayor Freddy Greaver set the tune with straight drives along the fairway and were soon followed by a crowd of keen golfers taking advantage of a perfect day.
The winners were Mpho Makhado with 44 points (A Division 0-9), Ryan Chandler with 43 points (B Division 10 – 15), Kenny Mboyana with 38 points (C Division 16 – 24) and Mash Makena with 37 points (Ladies Division).
Joe Legora, Daan Kampherbeek, Fundi Malaza and Ryan Chandler were nearest to the pin on the 4th, 8th, 11th and 16th hole respectively.
Nola Peceur, Daan Kampherbeek and Kenneth Mboyana had the longest drive on the 1st, 7th and 17th holes respectively.
Polokwane Executive Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng anticipated that the event should raise in excess of R1 million that will be used to augment the Executive Mayor’s Bursary Fund for students with potential who do not have the financial resources to attend institutions of further learning.
Funds will also be allocated to deserving charities in the municipal area.
