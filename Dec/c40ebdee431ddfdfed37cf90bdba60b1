Polokwane City Football Club appointed former Orlando Pirates Football Club defender, Clinton Larsen as their head coach last Thursday.
Larsen who formerly coached at Chippa United, Golden Arrows and Bloemfontein Celtic Football Club takes over from Zlatko Krmpotic, who vacated his position last month.
City is currently in the 14th position of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) with 13 points after 14 matches.
The club’s chief operations officer Tincy Tema said Larsen knows the culture of South African football and will help the club to avoid relegation. “He played and coached in South Africa. He has experience and we are hopeful that he will help us get out of relegation zone,” Tema said.
