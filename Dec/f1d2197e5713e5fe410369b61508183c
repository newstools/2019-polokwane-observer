Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects who allegedly robbed a 69-year-old woman of a large amount a cash she withdrew from a local bank in Seshego last Tuesday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the woman withdrew money from the account of a stokvel group at a local bank at the Seshego Circle Centre before boarding a taxi home.
When she arrived home she noticed two men in a grey unknown bakkie parked outside. While making her way into her yard the men alighted from the vehicle and accosted her, according to Mojapelo.
He added that the woman apparently screamed for help but to no avail as two more suspects arrived in a Nissan 1400 bakkie. They were allegedly armed and took the bag with money before fleeing the scene.
Mojapelo advised stokvel members and the community in general to avoid carrying large amounts of cash and to rather use alternatives such as electronic bank transfers to distribute money.
Anyone with information regarding the incident can contact the crime stop number on 08600 10111 or report to the nearest Police station.
