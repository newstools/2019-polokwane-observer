A 45-year-old man is expected to appear in the Vuwani Magistrate’s Court as soon as he has recuperated from injuries sustained during an alleged attack by community members following an incident during which he apparently stabbed his 35-year-old wife to death on Saturday. According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo the incident happened at Tshino location at about 10:30.
It is alleged that the suspect accused his wife of cheating and a heated argument reportedly followed. Subsequently the woman was stabbed and hacked with a sharp instrument resulting in her demise on the scene, according to Mojapelo.
He added that angry community members pursued the suspect, caught him and started assaulting him. Police were called and rescued the man from the mob by arresting him. He was then taken to a local hospital where he was admitted under Police guard.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has condemned the incident and warned communities to desist from resorting to violent behaviour when dealing with domestic issues. “The Police will deal decisively with any perpetrators of gender-based violence and this arrest should send a strong message about our determination to stamp it out,” Ledwaba was quoted to have said.
