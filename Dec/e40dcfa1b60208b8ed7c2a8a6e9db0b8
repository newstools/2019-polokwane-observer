The Shoprite Group recently hosted a Giving Tuesday Initiative event at Ga-Mothapo village to create awareness about the impact the group does in various communities.
Giving Tuesday is the retailer’s global movement aimed at encouraging charitable giving ahead of the Festive Season.
At the event the group met with the We Can Women’s Cooperative in Ga-Mothapo village which grows fresh vegetables to feed the learners of a nearby school.
The retailer assisted the cooperative by installing a water tank and put up a fence around their field.
Lunga Schoeman, Corporate Social Investment manager was quoted to have said fighting hunger is a major focus for them as Africa’s largest food retailer and that’s why they support almost 100 community food gardens and more than 300 home gardens. “If you put all these gardens together they would cover some 2 million m²,” Schoeman stated.
Shoprite partners with food gardens to ensure that they become sustainable enough to keep on providing fresh produce well into the future. The support for these projects include extensive training workshops, the provision of gardening infrastructure, tools and the donation of plant materials. The retailer also partners with early childhood development centres and further supports communities by organising clean-up events and being among the first to provide relief following devastating fires or floods.
