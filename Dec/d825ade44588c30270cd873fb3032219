In preparation for the onset of the Festive Season Police and other role players in the province began several weeks ago to turn Polokwane and the rest of Limpopo into a zero-tolerance zone for criminals and traffic offenders.
Recently Police again confirmed their readiness and commitment towards the task ahead with the official launch of the provincial Festive Season operations by the Deputy Minister of Police Cassel Mathale at Ga-Sekororo in the Tzaneen Cluster.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that, subsequent to the launch and, to a lesser extent several weeks before the launch, the Police began to heighten patrols, stop-and-search activities and roadblocks at all identified hotspots.”
“We have also started supporting law enforcement on our roads, thereby preventing possible crimes that are targeted at motorists. We are, in the same breadth, warning community members to resort to making use of public transport instead of hitchhiking as many people have in the past fallen victims of crimes committed by some motorists,” Mojapelo stated.
He further indicated that patrols are also focusing on all shopping centres and malls to prevent theft and common robberies committed against shoppers and those making use of ATMs.
“We are at the same time urging our communities to desist from withdrawing large sums of money as this attracts criminals. People must opt for conducting electronic transactions in the banks and making use of their bank cards for purchases.”
“The Police are ready to deal with any criminality during this Festive Season and we call on all our communities to work with us to ensure their safety,” he concluded.
At the time of going to print no comment had been received from Polokwane Municipality and Joel Seabi, Department of Health and Transport and Community Safety spokesperson could also not be reached.
