Last Thursday evening was a highlight on the social calendar of residents of Our Home/Ons Tuiste when they attended a Christmas party hosted by the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 at the club house.
Rotarians Johan Joubert and Bok van Kraayenburg prepared four chicken and venison potjies while the Rotary Anns under the leadership of Lara Kirkpatrick ensured that there were ample side dishes as well as dessert and drinks to make the evening a great success.
