Provincial dam levels were at 49,0% by Friday, declining by 1% compared to the previous weekâ€™s figure of 49,1% and the Limpopo Department of Water and Sanitation appealed to consumers to use water sparingly.
A report released by the department quoted Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu saying that of the 28 state owned dams in Limpopo none were 100% full. The report indicated that 14 dams are between 50% and 100% while 14 others were below 50%. The Middle-Letaba, Glen Alpine, Modjadji, Tzaneen and Doorndraai dams are below 10%.
The Polokwane water supply systems were at 46,2%, compared to 46,8% in the previous week, with a decline of 27,9% compared to last year this time. Ebenezer Dam, which supplies the majority of the communities around Polokwane, has dropped from 30,9% in the previous week to 29,6% last week, while Tzaneen Dam raises a serious concern as it dropped to 5,1% last week. Flag Boshielo Dam declined from 52,7% in the previous week to 52,4% last week.
