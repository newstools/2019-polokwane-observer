The Marishane Youth Development Forum and Lemapo VW Crew recently embarked on a community road show as part of their annual charity campaign to the benefit of less privileged persons in the Marishane area and surrounds.
Koketso Marishane, Marishane Youth Envoy said they donated blankets and food parcels to indigent families. “We do this every Festive Season and we are happy to touch the lives of the less fortunate. Our future goal is to visit needy communities in the province,” he said.
Barney Masemola, Lemapo VW Crew National President was quoted to have said their mission was to contribute towards the reduction of poverty, inequality and unemployment in the country.
They do so through the deployment of various effective and efficient mechanisms and channels that ensure their programmes positively bring about meaningful change.
