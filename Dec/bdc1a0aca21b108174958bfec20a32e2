Liberian striker Terrence Tisdell was released from his contract with Baroka Football Club last Thursday.
Tisdell joined Bakgakga in July has struggled ever since to establish himself at the club.
He played seven matches for the club and could not register his name on the scoreboard.
Club spokesperson Mogau Maredi said the decision to release Tisdell was due to his inability to adapt to the teamâ€™s style of play.
The club also announced Malawian international Gerald Phiri as new captain.
Phiri takes over from Mduduzi Mdantsane who was part of the Baroka squad that won the Telkom Knockout cup last season.
