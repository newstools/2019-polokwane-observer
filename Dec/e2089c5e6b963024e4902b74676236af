The Festive Season was officially announced at Mall of the North during a Community Christmas Parade hosted at the shopping hub on Saturday.
Dancers from local dance schools as well as members of Gymstars, the South African Army Band Limpopo and Limpopo K9 Academy joined in a parade through the mall.
The parade started at the food court on the upper level and continued to the lower level resulting in shoppers joining the activities and getting into the festive mood.
Mall of the North Marketing Manager Mari Delport explained that the purpose of the event was to announce the Festive Season and to create a merry mood among shoppers and tenants. She added that Santa Claus also pitched and handed out sweets to children. Shoppers also took the opportunity to take photos with Santa.
Delport thanked Kryolan Polokwane, Mac Cosmetics, Edgars, Foschini, Woolworths and Truworths for sponsoring the make-up of the dancers as well as Panarottis for sponsoring their lunch.
