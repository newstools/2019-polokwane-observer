A Good Samaritan, Etta Kambwiri, attached to an insurance and financial institution in the city reached out to Centenary House, a project of Association for Persons with Disability (APD) Limpopo by donating eight mattresses valued at R15 000 to beneficiaries at the organisation on Friday.
She said her employer gives each employee R50 000 every year for them to identify and charity organisation they can sponsor. She indicated that she chose APD because she has been volunteering at the centre for a while a saw a need to support them. Kambwiri added that although the mattresses are not enough for all the beneficiaries at the centre, she was delighted that at least eight people will sleep on comfortable beds.
She cautioned that her employer prefers that employees sponsor everlasting equipment than food parcels and reiterated that they mostly support old age homes, disability centres, children centres and schools.
APD Limpopo Director Christa van der Walt said poor mattresses can cause secondary disability hence they were happy to receive such a donation. She highlighted that the centre caters for 54 residents who canâ€™t afford to buy mattresses. She added that although the number of mattresses they received does not correspond with the number of residents, they make a huge difference. Van der Walt thanked Kambwiri for choosing APD as a charity organisation of her choice and went on to plead with other companies and individuals to support the centre in any way possible.
