A week after a woman was allegedly robbed of a large amount of cash at Savannah Mall another incident occurred at the same shopping hub during which two men were allegedly shot several times at an eatery last Sunday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Police are investigating two cases of attempted murder and that a manhunt for the suspects has been launched since the incident.
He said that the shooting happened at about 02:55 at a restaurant when Matome Sefala and Clyde Neveling were allegedly accosted by three gun-wielding suspects wearing balaclavas. The suspects immediately opened fire on the two victims where after they fled the scene, according to Mojapelo, who added that both victims had suffered bullet wounds.
He said the suspects apparently fled either on motorbikes or in a silver Toyota Corolla.
Mojapelo indicated that the motive behind the shooting was still unknown and investigations are continuing.
Savannah Mall Manager Karen Botha confirmed the incident: “According to information we received it was an alleged business deal gone wrong. On camera footage it can be seen how two men enter the eatery. It seems as if an argument between one of them and a man inside the eatery ensued followed by a shot(s) being fired,” Botha said, adding that the shooter(s) walked out of the eatery after the incident.
“We cannot confirm that anyone was wearing a balaclava. We also checked on camera footage of the mall and no motorcycles were observed,” she said.
In a statement it was mentioned that one of the victims offered a R100 000 reward for information that might lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspects.
