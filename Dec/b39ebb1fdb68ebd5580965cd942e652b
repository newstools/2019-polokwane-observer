Pakistani national Salman Hamid (49) appeared in Polokwane Magistrate’s Court last Thursday on charges relating to the alleged contravention of South Africa’s immigration laws. He was granted R2 000 bail.
A case of intimidation allegedly stemming from an incident in Nirvana around the first week of last month was recently provisionally withdrawn against Hamid and a second accused before he was re-arrested in connection with the current case. It was learnt that a case of extortion was provisionally withdrawn against two more accused around the same time.
Last week National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi indicated that Hamid was suspected of being in South Africa illegally and of fraudulently obtaining an identification document.
Response to further questions about the provisional withdrawal of charges against Hamid and three more accused and verification of his travel and identification documents amid him being granted bail of R500 at Westenburg Police Station late afternoon on the day of his initial arrest is still awaited.
Hamid is expected to appear in court again on 28 February next year. Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the details of the case and that a second suspect was still on the run in connection with similar charges.
