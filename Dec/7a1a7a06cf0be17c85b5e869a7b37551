A kind heart and a way with words helped Lebogang Mashapa to get Mporeana Pre-School at Ga-Mashashane area a fresh, new look.
The 29-year-old former learner whose mother is an educator and whose daughter is a learner at the school, said the site housing the 52 children was in desperate need of a face-lift. So when leading water brand, aQuellé, launched its New Look competition on Facebook and Twitter to coincide with the update of its logo and labels, Mashapa jumped at the opportunity to make her mother’s dream to come true.
The pre-school was one of many schools the organisation selected from scores of requests on the brand’s social media platforms from around the country to benefit from a sponsored make-over.
Marketing Manager Suzelle Stegen was quoted in a statement to have said: “Because we at aQuellé updated our logo and labels, giving the brand a new look, we decided to share this joy by giving some communities a new look.”
Mashapa’s sincere plea touched the right hearts and over two days in early October staff from the KwaZulu-Natal-based company travelled to the dusty village hundreds of kilometres away to re-paint and decorate classrooms, fix windows, and install new doors and signs. “We live in a rural area where there is not much money and the school was very rundown. The rooms were dark and sad, and there was a need for maintenance. We do our best to make life better for the children,” Mashapa was quoted to have said.
