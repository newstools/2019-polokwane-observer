The Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Unit’s continued efforts to track down corrupt officials at testing stations across the province led to the arrest of eight suspects at Malamulele and Mutale testing stations last Thursday.
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke said the suspects arrested at Mutale are ME Khangale, T Tshikalange, R Rammenu, KS Netshimboni, MB Matsila, MJ Netshizwi and PM Mudau.
They appeared in the Mutale Magistrate’s Court on Friday and were granted bail of R10 000 each. The case was postponed to 27 February.
At the same time TG Netshidzivhe appeared in the Malamulele Magistrate’s Court and was remanded until Friday.
Maluleke was not able to provide the full names of the suspects at the time of going to print.
He indicated other suspects included a senior licensing officer, three examiners, two clerks, a cashier, an instructor, a general worker and a middleman.
The arrests follow an ongoing community outcry since 2017 about alleged corruption at the respective testing stations. The unit, in collaboration with Road Traffic Management Cooperation Centre, embarked on investigations and it was revealed that driver’s licences were sold at a minimum of R8 600 per applicant, according to Maluleke.
More arrests are expected.
