Although Police in Mokopane fired rubber bullets and stun grenades at a crowd in the area yesterday (Thursday), all is calm today and they have the situation under control. This follows a planned shutdown for yesterday and today (Friday) amid simmering tensions.
Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe this morning said at present there was no threat that justified the closing of businesses. He could, however, not indicate how many, if any businesses were actually closed today. Attempts to source comment from Mogalakwena Municipality Spokesperson Malesela Selokela proved futile.
Mogalakwena Mayor Andrina Matsemela in an earlier media statement reportedly said: “We would like to assure all residents of Mogalakwena that those who are going to work, school and various areas that it will be business as usual. Residents who wish to visit the municipality should be aware that services will not be affected since service delivery is the core function of the municipality. We further inform them that members of South African Police Services will be on the lookout.”
