Athletes looking for some adventure can look forward to the annual Mazda 2-in-1 Nite Race to be hosted at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on 4 October. The event, presented in conjunction with Polokwane Athletic Club, is scheduled to start at 18:30 and entries can be submitted at the same venue from 16:30 to 18:15.
The event offers a 5 and 10 km race costing R40 and R70 respectively while grandmasters will only pay half price. Temporary licences are available at R30.
Every entrant will receive a glow stick and there will be medals for all finishers.
The organisers have reminded that all children must be accompanied by adults.
