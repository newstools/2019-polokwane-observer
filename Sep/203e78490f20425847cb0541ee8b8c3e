Work on Sanral’s N1 ring road project resumed earlier this month and the revised completion date is now November next year. In a press release by Sanral, it was con? rmed that the R226,5 million project had been awarded to Edwin Construction (Pty) Ltd. This comes after the project with a R640 million price ticket was on hold for more than a year after the original contractor, Basil Read was placed under business rescue. According to Sanral, the remainder of the project includes the completion of the new road, widening and strengthening of the old double road which will become the new south bound carriageway, completion of the new intersections
at the R37 (Lydenburg) and P977 (Silikon) road crossings, bridge structures, culverts, road markings, studs, signage, fencing and drainage. The contractor will also be responsible for cleaning up and ? nishing off the road reserve, quarries and borrow pits. “It is our hope that this project will reach completion by November 2020. Its success will increase safety and improve the ? ow of traf? c towards the Polokwane CBD,” Progress Hlahla, Regional Manager of Sanral’s Northern Region was quoted to have said. Hlahla added that the road will remain safe throughout the upcoming Festive Season. “A quali? ed and experienced traf? c safety of? cer will be appointed, whose sole responsibility will be to look after road safety issues on a daily basis,” Hlahla said.
