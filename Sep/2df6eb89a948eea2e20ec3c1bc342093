Learners and the elderly stand to benefit from resolutions taken during the Mahlalerwa Transport Association’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in Polokwane on Saturday.
Chairperson of the association, Dikeledi Madigoe said they intend, through their corporate social investment programme, to donate school uniforms to underprivileged learners at schools in the Lepelle Nkumpi area in the near future. The association also wants to adopt old age homes and orphanage centres in the area.
Madigoe also indicated that they plan to engage Lepelle Nkumpi Municipality on the status of the taxi rank in Zone F, Le­bowakgomo. He remarked that they want the municipality to ensure that the taxi rank is clean and has proper road markings. “We also want them to fix the light adjacent to the taxi rank. That is our area of operation and it is important to keep it clean at all the times. Commuters are our bosses and it is important to ensure that they are happy all the time,” Madigoe said.
She added that they want to engage the South African Police Service (SAPS) on the safety of the commuters at the taxi rank. “There are lots of people selling street drugs such as nyaope and marijuana at the taxi rank. Their activities put our commuters at risk and we want the Police to intervene and put a stop to the problem,” Madigoe stated.
The association operates from Lebowa­kgomo and delivers a long-distance commuting service to Gauteng.
