Electricity interruptions in Modimolle-Mookgophong Municipality by Eskom have been avoided for the immediate future following a judgement delivered in the High Court of South Africa (Limpopo Division) in Polokwane this morning (Tuesday) after Eskom and the municipality agreed to postpone the adjudication of the matter until 12 November in order to determine certain facts that are part of the dispute. This includes the interest levied on the overdue account, as well as the accuracy of the meters used by Eskom to monitor the bulk electricity supply to the municipality.
According to Modimolle-Mookgophong Mayor Marlene van Staden, this morning’s agreement includes an undertaking by Eskom not to interrupt or to terminate bulk electricity supply to the municipality until the dispute is finally adjudicated. “It has always been our intention to settle the municipality’s debt and to start paying creditors within the stipulated time frames, however, in order to do this, we must first improve our financial situation and have already taken steps to deal with this matter. I will continue to keep residents updated regarding our progress towards creating a financially stable and viable municipality as well as our efforts to prevent electricity cuts which will no doubt bring undue hardship to our communities and kill jobs,” Van Staden said.
