The eleven victims of a head-on collision at Chuenespoort outside Polokwane yesterday (Sunday) have not yet been identified.
According to Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe the deceased will only be identified once their next of kin have been informed about their demise. He confirmed that most of the victims were apparently from the Chuene area. A case of culpable homicide is being investigated.
Department of Transport and Community Safety Spokesperson Joel Seabi could not be reached this morning (Monday) to obtain an indication on how many fatal accidents were reported in the province on the weekend.
The accident involving a bakkie and passenger vehicle reportedly happened when one of the drivers apparently lost control and swerved into oncoming traffic.
