Cancer Association of South Africa (Cansa) Polokwane treated its patients, cancer survivors, volunteers, friends and family to mouthwatering meals and good music during an event hosted at Taberna Dei Moederkampus on Saturday.
It was an emotional moment when attendees lit up candles in memory of those who lost their battle with cancer. Musicians Ryan Walt and Steven Sterling added a lighter note to the occasion when they performed great songs for the audience. While there was a lot of interest in being part of the celebration the hall could unfortunately only accommodate 150 persons.
Cansa Polokwane representative Marna van Rensburg indicated that the event, aimed at helping cancer patients and survivors heal while having fun at the same time, was a first for them. She further outlined that some survivors had shared their sad stories with the audience, an exercise that assists in the healing process. Van Rensburg reiterated that they were planning to make the initiative an annual event and pleaded with companies and individuals to extend a helping hand to the association in order for them to raise the funds needed to do so.
She thanked everyone who made the gathering a success and encouraged families to be part of cancer victims’ healing process by being supportive, loving and caring.
