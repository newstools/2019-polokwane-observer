Consumers in parts of the city and surrounds experienced low water pressure and total shutdowns last week and during the weekend due to the low levels of the city reservoirs.
Communications and Marketing Manager of the municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said that the higher lying areas were most affected, although enough water did not reach some other areas as well at some times. Mothapo explained that, in order to provide pressure and flow to the higher lying areas as well, supply to the lower lying areas was throttled to allow a more balanced flow to the entire area of supply.
This morning (Monday) the level of the Potgieter Drive reservoir was back at 65%, while the three reservoirs on Krugersburg adjacent to Ster Park were at 3%, 15% and 18% respectively. The Seshego reservoir was at 13% and the water flow from Olifantspoort and Ebenezer were 120 and 115 litres per second respectively.
Mothapo could not indicate when water supply to all areas would be restored. “The reservoir levels have to pick up while residents are still using water at the same time and the rehabilitation of levels therefore depends on the usage,” Mothapo explained and added that water tankers are deployed throughout.
