Stanford Lake College (SLC) is the proud provincial winner of the 2019 Spur Schools’ XCO Series.
Four hundred and thirty-two entries from across the province were received for the fourth and final round of the series, the ‘Tour de Lake’, that took place at SLC recently.
According to Beth Coetzee, marketer at the school, the course was characterised by lots of climbing, dust and technical areas that offered a real challenge to the high and primary school entrants. Of the 30 SLC learners who took part eight managed to make the top five in their age categories.
Once all the points accrued during the four legs of the tour had been processed SLC was announced as the Limpopo winners with overall podium places in their respective categories going to Herman Fourie, winner Youth Boys, Lianke Fourie, second Sub-Junior Girls, Lara Dando and Gunther Katzke, third in respectively Youth Women and Youth Men, Isabella Drewett and Rachel Thompson second and third respectively in the Girls u.15.
Lianke, Herman, Gunther, Isabella, Rachel and Lara received their Limpopo colours and will represent the province at the National Schools’ Championships which will be held at Wagpos High School in Brits later this month.
