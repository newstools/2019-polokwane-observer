Nearly two months after Police con?scated 152 ?rearms from employees of non-operational security companies in the Thohoyandou area, another breakthrough was made when 108 ?rearms and 134 rounds of live ammunition were seized during an operation in the same area on the weekend.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the operation focussed on security companies which had closed down but whose employees who were still in possession of company ?rearms.
The weapons and ammunition were con?scated from 19 closed security companies and led to 48-year-old suspect being arrested for possession of an unlicensed ?rearm and ammunition. The recovered arms and ammunition will be destroyed after proper procedures have been completed, Ngoepe indicated. Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has cautioned security companies not complying with the Fire Arms Control Act to pull up their socks as failing to do so would result in them being dealt with harshly.
The arrestee was expected to appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week. More arrests are expected.
