Congratulatory messages continue to pour in for Ndlovu Youth Choir who made the country and Limpopo proud by reaching the finals of America’s Got Talent following their outstanding performance on Wednesday.
The group, from Moutse village near Groblersdal, performed Whitney Houston’s hit song ‘Higher Love’ to claim a spot in the finals. In a statement, Premier Stan Mathabatha was quoted to have said: “We have never doubted them and I still believe they will win this show. Limpopo and South Africa will support them all the way.”

Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka also applauded the group as she emphasised that Ndlovu Youth Choir was one of only five acts to have made the finals of the show.
“The choir has achieved what has never been accomplished before by anyone in the province and the country. We are really proud of their achievement and success. They have brightened this country and the African continent amid all the conflict going on at the moment,” Moraka remarked.
In a post on its social media page, the choir expressed appreciation for the messages of support and congratulations received: “We hope that our performance reminded the world that we are all connected by the spirit of humanity. Love is an unbreakable force which will always conquer hate. Thank you to you all for helping us share our infectious energy with the world and to America’s Got Talent for giving us the opportunity to perform on the biggest talent stage.”
