The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo is seeking an urgent meeting with Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba to discuss what is regards a worrying increase in farm attacks and murders in the province. The DA further intends launching a petition for the implementation of a comprehensive rural safety plan.
The move follows an attack on Ferdie Jacobs at his home in Louis Trichardt yesterday. In a media release DA Provincial Leader Jacques Smalle stated that Jacobs apparently heard footsteps in his house and upon investigation discovered two criminals who have gained access to the residence. “He was attacked with a knife and sustained cut marks on his arm and leg. He was also hit over the head with a blunt object. The attackers fled the scene with an unknown amount of money.”
The incident added to the escalating number of farm attacks and murder cases across the province, Smalle further stated. “These attacks and murders are untenable and it is clear that the DA’s continued appeal for the integration of rural safety units has fallen on deaf ears.”
On behalf of the party he expressed concern about farmers and farmworkers across the province having become vulnerable targets. “Not only do these farmers have to live in fear but these attacks also affect the local economy, employment and food security.”
According to Smallle the DA would also seek an update regarding all their investigations into farm murders and attacks as well as plans to combat such crimes during the meeting with Ledwaba.
