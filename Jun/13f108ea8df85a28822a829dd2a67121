From their rendering of the energetic cha-cha-chÃ  to the stately waltz all attention was on the six dancers from Siloe School for the Blind who set the stage alight to win the recent provincial dance competition held at Ipelegeng Special School, Tafelkop.
Although the school took eight dancers to the competition, only six competed. After displaying their extraordinary dance moves, the six were named the provincial winners. They were presented with two trophies each and are through to the national round set for August in North West.
Proud dance coach Joyce Ngobeni indicated that the school was delighted with the learners and that they were eager to commence with preparations for the nationals. She further stated that they were confident that the dancers would wow the adjudication panel and win the national title in both categories. Ngobeni congratulated the team and urged them to continue working hard to achieve great things in the future.
