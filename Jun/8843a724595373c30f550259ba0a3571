About 60 athletes from Mzansi Athletics Club are fit and eager to join myriads of runners from all over the world at the starting line of the 2019 Comrades Marathon on Sunday.
The marathon will start at the City Hall in Durban and finish at the Scottsville Racecourse in Pietermaritzburg. The race distance is approximately 87 km but the distance is subject to change and will be confirmed in the final race instructions.
Chairperson of club, Bilisi Rambiyana said all athletes have prepared well for the marathon and they are ready to compete. “We started preparing last year. We have a strong team of athletes that will represent us and the province well. It will be our third participation at the event and we are looking forward to make the best of it. We are the second largest club in the province and our participation at the marathon shows that we are growing,” Rambiyana said at their send-off ceremony in Polokwane on Saturday.
He urged all their novices to enjoy themselves.“You must go to Comrades and finish the race. If you finish the race it will encourage a lot of people. Go out there and give it your best. We wish all runners from the province good luck at the event,” Rambiyana stated.
