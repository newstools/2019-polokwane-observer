Black Leopards Football Club has acquired the services of former Bafana Bafana player Thuso Phala, and Botswanan midfielder Mogakolodi Ngele, both midfielders, ahead of the new Premier Soccer League (PSL) season which commences in August.
Lidoda duvha also bolstered their technical team by bringing in Lionel Soccoia as a head coach, former Kaizer Chiefs defender Patrick Mabedi as his assistant and Mlungisi Ngubane as team manager last Thursday.
Club spokesperson, Berry Ramunenyiwa said Phala and Ngele will bring experience to the team and boost its attack in the new season. “Both have mammoth experience in the PSL. They are versatile players, they have played for big teams in the country and I think they will add value in the team.
As for the new technical team our previous coach left at the end of the previous season. He was a good coach and we were looking for someone of his calibre. We believe Soccoia is the right man for the job because he also had vast experience in Africa,” Ramunenyiwa explained.
He cofirmed that all players reported for duty on Monday following a six week break. “We are glad to have everyone back after a long off-season break. The technical team was hard at work with old and new players on Monday and we cannot wait for the start of the new season,” he concluded.
