It was a day full of excitement and surprises when young clowns at Mitchell House’s early childhood development centre, Squirrel’s Nest delivered great acts in front of a large audience during a circus on children’s play area on Friday.
Parents and guardians took time off their busy schedule to come and watch the school’s young clowns, acrobats, dancers and magicians perform on stage. Toddlers were dressed in fun costumes and had their faces painted to imitate real clowns.
The crowd was astonished when the young magicians made objects disappear without a trace while other performers had the audience clapping and whistling.
Head of Squirrel’s Nest Lee-Anne Petzer said this was an opportunity for the toddlers to have fun while at the same time learning how to use their bodies. She further stated that it took a lot of hard work from educators and learners to perfect the acts and applauded each and every one of them for a job well done. Petzer indicated that all the acts were well executed and the audience amazing. She thanked parents and guardians for their continued support.
