The Flora Park dam, considered as a breeding ground and hotspot for criminal activities, was closed down following a directive from Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba. This follows the announcement of his intention to do so during his address at the Youth Day Imbizo hosted at the facility on Friday.
“What happened with the case of Thorisho Themane (28) emanated from a number of drugs being smoked here (Flora Park dam) by the suspects. That is the reason why, at the end of the day, I, the Provincial Commissioner have on my own decided to close this dam. So this dam, get to know that when you move off here, you do not get back,” Ledwaba said on Friday.
He emphasised that the Police have, since the incident in February that allegedly led to Themane’s death, arrested more than 250 people at the dam for public drinking. He added that sector policing would also be increased by conducting more patrols in this area.
He extended his gratitude towards the Polokwane Municipality for not having any objection towards his decision to close the dam and stressed that the step was dictated by the need to avoid big groups gathering and alcohol and drugs being used on the premises.
Ledwaba announced his decision during the Youth Day Imbizo hosted by the provincial Police. The imbizo also saw Deputy Provincial Commissioner responsible for Policing, Jan Scheepers addressing guests with the message that it was time for individuals and communities to change their values.
“Crime-linked violence is on the rise. Learners at school are fighting each other and their educators. You no longer see children playing in the streets which is a clear indication of a society that is no longer healthy,” Scheepers said.
