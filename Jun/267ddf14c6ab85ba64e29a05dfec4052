A choir made up of 55 visually impaired singers from Siloe School for the Blind obtained the second position during the 2019 ABC Motsepe South African Schools Choral Eisteddfod provincial championships held at Bolivia Estate last Thursday.
The choir missed out on a ticket to the nationals as they secured the second spot after scoring 65%. This is the first time in more than 20 years the school choir placed second in the competition. Siloe School for the Blind in the past always represented Limpopo at the nationals in choir contests according to choir conductor Molelekoa Mabotja. The choir was however, due to circumstances, inactive for five years and had only a week in which to prepare for the most recent competition.
The choir won both the Mogodumo circuit round and Capricorn South District leg to proceed to the provincials. Mabotja was confident that they would reach the nationals next year as they intended to prepare thoroughly henceforth.
