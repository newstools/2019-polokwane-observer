A Thabazimbi based pastor is expected to appear in the Bela-Bela Magistrate’s Court today (Thursday) facing a charge of rape after he was arrested on the weekend for in connection with an incident with a 12-year-old girl last Monday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that the pastor appeared in court on Monday and was remanded in custody until today for a bail application.
Ngoepe reiterated that on the day of the incident the pastor allegedly arrived at the girl’s parents’ home for a prayer session when he reportedly told the mother that the girl is sick. He allegedly told the victim’s mother that the girl should accompany him to a nearby river for healing purposes, according to Ngoepe.
Reportedly the mother later, when the two had not returned, began panicking and informed the father who then went to look for them.
On his way to the river he was met by his half-naked child, running and screaming for help, claiming that the pastor had raped her.
Police were immediately notified and the pastor pursued until he was arrested on the weekend.
