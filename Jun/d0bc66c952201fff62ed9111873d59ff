The Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (Dawn) in Limpopo is expected to visit the Kgatle family in Ngaleng village outside Mankweng this afternoon (Monday) following an incident during which 38-year-old Samuel Kgatle allegedly hung his two children Anna (8) and Marry (5) before killing himself on Saturday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that two cases of murder are being investigated while an inquest was also registered.
He said it is alleged that the Kgatle couple recently separated following a domestic dispute which occurred last year.
The mother took her two children and went to stay at her parental home in Sekgosese near Giyani, according to Ngoepe who added that the children on Saturday went to their father’s home in Mankweng to visit him for the school holidays.
He further remarked that the husband allegedly called his wife and a telephonic argument ensued which reportedly resulted in the father hanging his children in separate rooms before fleeing the scene.
The Police were informed and responded to the call to discover bodies of the two children. A manhunt for the husband was immediately launched and resulted in him being discovered at another house in the area where he reportedly hung himself.
Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Jan Scheepers has strongly condemned the continuing brutal acts of violent crimes perpetrated against children in some parts of the province.
In a press statement Dawn has sent its deepest condolence to the Kgatle family and their friends and condemned the incident as it highlighted the vulnerability of children in society.
