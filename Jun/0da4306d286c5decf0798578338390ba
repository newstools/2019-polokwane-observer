Two suspects, Mdudzi Semilani (29) and Flengi Shon Ramalepe (33) are expected to make a second appearance in the Bolobedu Magistrateâ€™s Court tomorrow (Friday) after they were arrested on charges of stock theft on the weekend.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that the duo appeared in court on Monday after which they were remanded in custody until tomorrow when they are expected to apply for bail.
This follows an incident on Saturday when Police intercepted a bakkie loaded with the carcasses of five cattle at Shawela village.
Ngoepe said two of the passengers ran away while Police managed to arrest the driver and a third passenger on the spot. He added that the other suspects have been identified and that arrests are expected soon.
Ngoepe indicated that the carcasses have already been identified by the owners through brand marks.
Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the remaining suspects can contact the crime stop number on 08600 10111 or report to the nearest Police station.
