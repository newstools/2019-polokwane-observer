The Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (Ledet) is monitoring a pride of 14 lions roaming in the vicinity of Phalaborwa after the animals seemingly escaped from Kruger National Park (KNP).
This morning (Friday) departmental spokesperson Zaid Kalla told Polokwane Observer that the department had been informed of a sighting around Foskor Mine yesterday, but couldnâ€™t say when the lions could have escaped from the park.
Kalla said a group of rangers was closely monitoring the pride prior to the lions being darted in order for them to be released back into the park. Darting is likely to be done tomorrow, it was learnt. Another group of rangers was following the animal tracks to determine where they escaped, he indicated.
With the pride being monitored the Police could yesterday alert communities on the presence of the animals, Kalla said. He continued advising members of the public spotting wild animals in such an instance to immediately contact the department to have the animals captured and released again.
