Police have registered an inquest into the death of a security guard who was allegedly trampled by an elephant at Foskor Mine early Saturday morning.
The incident follows a day after reports were received that 14 lions, initially suspected to have escaped from the Kruger National Park (KNP), were roaming the same area.
According to Mienkie Ramakgoakgoa of the Provincial Police Communications Centre the security guard was identified as 45-year-old Eric Kgatla.
It is alleged that the deceased was on duty when attacked at about 04:20. He was trampled and died instantly, according to Ramakgoakgoa who confirmed that he was certified dead on the scene.
Departmental spokesperson of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (Ledet), Zaid Kala indicated this morning (Monday) that the lions had not escaped from KNP but has been an established pride in the area for years.
He said that Ledet officials visited the area on the weekend to monitor the pride. “The department hereby confirms that the lions have now returned to their usual location. The department also confirms that the animals will be kept within the area. The department’s role is to enforce control where human lives are threatened. The lions have not been of any threat to humans,” Kala was quoted in a recent press statement.
Media Liaison Officer at Foskor, Frans Makondo was apparently in a meeting when approached for comment this morning (Monday).
