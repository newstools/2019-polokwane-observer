Water consumers of the city are advised to take precautionary measures to deal with extensive expected water shortages as from Thursday.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo reported earlier today (Tuesday) that Lepelle Northern Water was planning to embark on a maintenance operation to clean the forebays and the Specon command reservoir on Thursday from 00:00 to 18:00. “It is expected that the water will take some time to reach Polokwane once the plant has been restarted and all areas of supply will be affected.
Lepelle Northern Water made an undertaking to do everything in its power to keep reservoirs with sufficient water for the period leading to the date of the activity,” Mothapo said.
Mothapo advised consumers to be prepared for the interruption of supply and to continue to use water sparingly and responsibly. “The municipality will deploy tankers to affected areas,” Mothapo confirmed.
