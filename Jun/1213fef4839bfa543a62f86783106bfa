Police investigations continue into the death of two young girls and their father after an alleged dispute between him and his ex-wife resulting in him hanging his children and himself in Ngaleng village outside Mankweng on Saturday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that two cases of murder were being investigated while an inquest was also registered.
He said it is alleged that the Kgatle couple recently separated following a domestic dispute which occurred last year.
The mother took her two children and went to stay at her parental home in Sekgosese near Giyani, according to Ngoepe who added that the children on Saturday went to their father’s home in Mankweng to visit him for the school holidays.
He stated that the husband allegedly called his wife and a telephonic argument ensued which reportedly resulted in the father hanging his children in separate rooms before fleeing the scene.
The Police were informed and responded to the call only to discover the bodies of the two children.
A manhunt for the husband was immediately launched and resulted in him being discovered at another house in the area where he reportedly hung himself.
They were identified as Samuel Kgatle (38) and his two children, Anna (8) and Marry (5).
Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Jan Scheepers has strongly condemned the continuing brutal acts of violent crimes perpetrated against children in some parts of the province.
The Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (Dawn) in Limpopo was expected to visit the Kgatle family on Monday.
In a press statement Dawn has sent its deepest condolence to the Kgatle family and their friends and condemned the incident as it highlighted the vulnerability of children in society.
