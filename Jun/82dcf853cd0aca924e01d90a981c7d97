Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba is anticipated to commence part-time lecturing in Pharmacology at the University of Limpopo’s (UL) School of Medicine.
Samuel Risenga, Director of the school said in a voice clip made available to Polokwane Observer that a shortage of staff exists in some of its faculties including Pharmacology.
“The Pharmacology course is normally taught by pharmacists. One has to be a clinical pharmacologist as it is disease and patient linked. We therefore need someone who is a medical doctor and has a pharmacology qualification.”
Ramathuba holds, over and above her qualification as medical doctor, a master’s degree in Pharmacology.
“We approached her as head of the medical fraternity in the province for assistance. We know that she is very busy that is why we asked if she can’t spare some of her time to teach on a part-time basis,” Risenga explained.
He stated that he personally met Ramathuba last week to discuss the matter, adding that they agreed that she would join the UL teaching staff as from August. A stipend is payable to part-time lecturers but Ramathuba said whatever she gets she will give to one of the needy students, Risenga remarked.
Department of Health spokesperson Neil Shikwambana could not comment on the topic as he indicated that the department and the university decided to centralise communication of the matter to UL.
