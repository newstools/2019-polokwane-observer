Baroka Football Club, in their intended pursuit of major titles in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) next season, acquired the services of Malawian International midfielder Gerald Phiri over the weekend.
Phiri, formerly with Be Forward Wanderers Football Club and Platinum Stars, signed a three year deal with Bakgaga.
The attacking midfielder was named player of the tournament while playing for his country at the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations Cup held in Durban recently.
He also shared the Golden Boot Award with teammate Gabadinho Mhango after they scored three goals each at the tournament.
Club chairperson, Khurishi Mphahlele said Phiri will add a different dimension to the club. “We are looking for quality players in the team and he is a quality player. We are not done with signing players. We are going to add more quality players for the club. We want to compete for every trophy that is on offer in the PSL next season and we need quality players to achieve that,” Mphahlele said.
