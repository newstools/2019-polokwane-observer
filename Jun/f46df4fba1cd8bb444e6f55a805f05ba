First choice goalkeeper of Baroka Football Club, Elvis Chipezeze has been included in the Zimbabwe squad that will participate at the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) tournament set to take place in Egypt from tomorrow (Friday) until 19 July.
Chipezeze joined Baroka last season and he played a pivotal role in the Ga-Mphahlele based outfit’s Telkom Knockout Cup victory.
He played in all Baroka’s Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches last season and was also key member of the Zimbabwean squad that helped them qualify for Afcon.
Club spokesperson, Mogau Maredi said Chipezeze was the epitome of hard work and a role model to many aspiring goalkeepers on the African continent.
“He has done well for himself and the club. He is hard working and we want him to do us proud and fly high the Baroka flag at the tournament,” Maredi said.
Baroka at the same time announced that they had parted ways with defender Thabiso Semenya who joined the club in October last year from Polokwane City Football Club.
Semenya was a pillar of strength in Baroka’s defence line during his 21 matches of the league.
“We decided not to renew his contract. He is a good servant of the game and he brought lot of experience to the team. He contributed immensely to the club and we wish him well in his future endeavours,” Maredi remarked.
