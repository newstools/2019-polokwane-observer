The Department of Social Development has budgeted R25 million to build offices for social workers deployed to Ha-Ravele community in Makhado area.
The construction of the project is expected to commence in the current financial year. This was revealed by Social Development MEC Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana during the sod turning ceremony at Ha-Ravele last Tuesday. In a clip made available to Polokwane Observer, Mokaba-Phukwana can be heard saying the department wants to take services closer to the people, adding that the offices would cater for 40 social workers. She said they recently learnt that social workers have been kicked out of clinics due to lack of office space hence the new building would come in handy.
Social Development MEC Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana addresses the community of Ha-Ravele.
“This is a community project that will benefit residents because the contractor has to employ people from this very community. We have labourers and engineers in this community and as a result such people must be afforded job opportunities. We will monitor the project until completion. We face a lot of challenges in our families hence the offices will ensure that residents share their turmoil with professional social workers in a confidential space,” Mokaba-Phukwana explained.
She urged social workers to be professional and receptive in order for residents to feel free when they share their issues. She went on to caution that any social worker who goes around spreading patients’ secrets will lose their jobs.
