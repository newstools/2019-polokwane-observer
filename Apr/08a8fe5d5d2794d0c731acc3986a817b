The Olifantspoort water plant of Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) has not been in operation since Saturday morning after it was allegedly invaded by community members of the Lesitse and Tswaing villages, seriously affecting water supply to residents of the city.
According to LNW Spokesperson Simon Mpamonyane, the invaders evicted officials of LNW from the premises and took the keys activating the system. “The matter has been reported to the Police and some community members are, however, still on the premises making it impossible to restart the plant,” Mpamonyane said.
The reason for the disruption of operations at Olifantspoort could not be officially established, however, postings on social media indicated that the communities were upset about service delivery issues.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said earlier this morning (Monday) that in the meantime the city currently only relies on water from Ebenezer Dam and the local boreholes and that the city reservoirs are therefore at critical levels. He could not indicate when pumping from Olifantspoort will be resumed and urged consumers to use water sparingly.
Earlier today (Monday) SAPS spokesperson Napure Manamela confirmed that a case of common robbery is being investigated but that no arrests have been made as yet. Manamela could, however, not explain why the Police have not as yet removed the trespassers at the plant.
