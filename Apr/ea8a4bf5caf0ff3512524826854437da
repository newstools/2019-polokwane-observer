A 38-year-old woman is expected to appear in the Musina Magistrateâ€™s Court this week following her arrest at Beit Bridge where she was found in possession of explosives on Sunday (yesterday).
Maphure Manamela of the Provincial Police Communications Centre indicated that the woman was arrested during a routine stop and search operation. Police reportedly directed a bus that had just crossed the border post to the inspection bay and during the ensuing search found 200 blasting cartridges wrapped in plastic and hidden in her luggage.
The origin and intended destination of the explosives are still being investigated. The suspect faces a charge of illegal possession of explosives.
