When the curtains rise for the grand finale of the 2019 Mrs Universe Africa pageant on 28 September at Roodepoort Theatre, in Gauteng Lolo Phala from Seshego will be among the bevy of beauties strutting her stuff to impress the judges.
The South African winner will take part in the Mrs Universe pageant set for 22 December to 1 January 2020 in China.
Phala says she want to win the title because it will enable her to become an ambassador to empower and inspire other women from impoverished backgrounds. “I want to contribute actively towards social uplifting and become a spokesperson on issues women in Africa face every day. I can achieve that best through the pageant title,” Phala said.
The 39-year-old mother of three said it was her husband, Charles Phala’s dream that she should enter the pageant. “My husband always reminds me how beautiful I am. He once said I must enter the Miss South Africa contest which I couldn’t then but. When I saw this opportunity it reminded me of his wish and I had to do it for the family.”
The responsibilities of the pageant finalists include selling 20 tickets for the pageant which retails at R400 each, do more charity work and amass more public votes.
