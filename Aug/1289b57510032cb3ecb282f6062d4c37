Two Police officers attached to the Polokwane Police Station were in for a surprise when they reported for duty on Tuesday evening only to be greeted by Station Commander Gift Makhubele ready to arrest them.
Provincial Police Communications Head, Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that the 35-year-old constable sergeant and 34-year-old constable were expected to appear in the Polokwane Regional Court yesterday (Wednesday) facing charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice.
Their arrest follows and incident when a pedestrian was killed during a hit-and-run in Penina Park earlier this month. A case of culpable homicide was opened and the driver involved arrested later that evening as he was not in possession of a valid driver’s licence, according to Mojapelo.
He said the two accused had, instead of locking up the driver, allegedly demanded R10 000 and released him.
“The overwhelming majority of South African Police Service members in this province are always performing their functions professionally and without reproach. The arrest of the two members must however send a strong message that corruption within our own ranks or anywhere else will not be tolerated and that decisive action will be taken against such tendencies,” Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba was quoted to have said.
