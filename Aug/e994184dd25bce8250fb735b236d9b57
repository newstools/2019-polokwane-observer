Police made a major breakthrough when they arrested a 24-year-old suspect and recovered 51 goats and 21 sheep at Ga-Madiba, Mahwelereng on Saturday.
Provincial Police Communications Head, Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that members of the Stock Theft Unit in Mahwelereng received information about the presence of suspected stolen livestock at ga-Madiba and were assisted by members of the Public Order Policing Unit (Pops) to conduct an operation which led to the arrest of the suspect.
First to be recovered were seven goats and three sheep found in possession of the arrested suspect. The rest were recovered from the premises of two other suspects who managed to evade arrest. The suspects, both known to the Police, are currently being sought.
Ten animals have already been positively identified by their owners.
Police are appealing to stock owners, especially those residing in the areas of Ga-Mashashane and Ga-Matlala outside Polokwane to report to the Mahwelereng Police Station for possible identification of livestock. Anyone whose goats or sheep have gone missing can contact Capt Kekana on 082 319 9318 or W O Sekwaila on 082 319 9532.
Meanwhile, Police are calling on Lucky Maluleke of Mshongo in Mahwelereng and Benny Matlou of Ga-Madiba to avail themselves at Mahwelereng Police Station as it is believed that they might be able to assist with the investigations.
The arrested suspect was expected to appear in the Mahwelereng Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week.
