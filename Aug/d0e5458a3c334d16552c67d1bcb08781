The 26 Zanis Gymnastics Academy gymnasts who entered the recent Limpopo Trampoline Championships hosted at the University of Pretoria won no fewer than 38 medals at the event.
Besides the 18 gold, 13 silver and seven bronze medals they collected, the gymnasts were also awarded Limpopo colours and will represent the province at the national North Zone Championships set to take place in Centurion next month.
