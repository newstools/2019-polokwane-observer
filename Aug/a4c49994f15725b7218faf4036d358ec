The representatives of the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) on Capricorn District Council are seemingly heating up remnants from the past with recently furnished questions to the council speaker regarding recommendations contained in the Gobodo Report of nine years ago.
The controversial document dating back to almost a decade ago followed a forensic accounting investigation into allegations of collusion in supply chain management procedures within the institution probed at the time.
In a letter containing questions on the issue and dated 21 August EFF party leader in CDM Council, Oscar Motolla requested feedback from Speaker Monica Mohale on the recommendations on alleged misappropriation of supply chain regulations reflected on in the report. He continued to pose the question whether the companies implicated in the report were still being engaged by the municipality in contract work and, if indeed so, what projects they were involved in.
In conclusion Motolla requested to be furnished with a copy of the Gobodo Report.
The EFF’s Whip on CDM Council, Ronny Malema stated that no response had thus far been received from Mohale and he indicated that the matter would be escalated for Council discussion through an intended motion to be forwarded in due course.
The EFF on the council wasn’t going to stop exposing alleged corruption within the municipality, he said in conclusion.
