A total of 152 firearms and 93 rounds of live ammunition were confiscated from security companies during a sting operation in Thohoyandou on Saturday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the operation focussed on security companies who have closed down and their employees who are still in possession of company firearms.
Crimes perpetuated through the use of firearms are immense, hence Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba’s decision to take it upon himself to dispatch the Flash Unit to trace and hunt down all security companies and their former employees.
During the operation in the Thohoyandou Cluster 34 security companies were visited and 152 firearms and 93 live rounds were recovered. The recovered firearms and ammunition will be destroyed after proper procedures are completed, according to Ngoepe.
This operation is part of the Police’s efforts to eradicate all possibilities of criminals committing crime through the use of firearms and similar operations will be conducted across the province, Ngoepe warned.
Nneke cautioned security companies not complying with the South African Fire Arms Control Act to pull up their socks as failing to do so will result in them facing the full might of the law.
Anyone with information about companies that are still operating under the same circumstances can contact investigating officer Justice Nchabeleng on 082 468 3848 or report to the nearest Police station.
