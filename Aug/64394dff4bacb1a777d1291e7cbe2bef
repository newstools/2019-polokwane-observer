Riley Filen, Grade 9 Stanford Lake College learner, is a talented downhill mountain biker with a passion for adrenalin, speed and the technical challenges presented by the discipline that is also known as the ‘Formula 1 of mountain biking’.
Last weekend’s round four of the SA Cup Downhill series held in Hartbeespoort saw Riley finishing in second place to win a silver medal. Beth Coetzee, the school’s head of marketing, informed that with this result Riley also managed to finish second in the series for Gauteng and Mpumalanga.
