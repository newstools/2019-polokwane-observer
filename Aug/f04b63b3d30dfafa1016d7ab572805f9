Another service pistol is now reportedly in the hands of a criminal after a Police woman was allegedly robbed of her gun during an incident in downtown Polokwane last Thursday evening.
This little over a month after a Police officer lost his gun during an altercation in Bendor when a rape suspect allegedly overwhelmed him during the apprehension process, took his gun and fled the scene in a Police vehicle.
According to information the latest incident happened just before 21:00 on the corner of Dahl and Jorissen streets when a Police woman was reportedly accosted by an unknown number of suspects. A source could not confirm what exactly happened but the officer was allegedly robbed of her service pistol by suspect(s) who fled in the direction of Westenburg in a red BMW without licence plates.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident and only remarked that it was being investigated.
When asked about the incident in June he responded that the perpetrator was still on the run as no arrest had been made yet.
During this incident Police officers responded to a call from a woman in Bendor who alleged that she had been raped. When the officers met the woman she accompanied them to a house in Schalk Drive where the suspect was apprehended.
It was learnt from a source that while the officers were taking the suspect to the Police van he resisted and a fight between him and one of the officers ensued. The officerâ€™s gun fell to the ground and the suspect got hold of it. Shots were fired and although the second officer retaliated the suspect managed the flee the scene with the Police vehicle.
The suspects abandoned the vehicle after crashing into a wall in Van Niekerk Street.
Anyone with information can contact investigating officer Philip Sekhwela on 072 717 8344.
