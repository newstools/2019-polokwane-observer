Consumers in the city and surrounds could expect water shortages later today (Thursday) due to no bulk supply from Lepelle Northern Water’s (LNW) Olifantspoort Water Treatment Works.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality Matshidiso Mothapo said that LNW has advised that the stoppage early this morning is due to failure of non-return valves from one of the pumps. All areas of supply including Ga-Chuene, Ga-Maja, Thokgwaneng, Ivydale, the city and Seshego may be affected.
LNW estimated that the work on the plant will take four to six hours where after supply will be restored. It will, however, take some hours until the reservoir levels have recovered to such an extent that water will reach consumers.
“Polokwane Municipality will provide regular updates regarding this situation. In the meantime, all areas receiving water are urged to use water sparingly. All users are urged to report water related challenges to the municipal water helpline on 015 290 2376 or 015 290 2629,” Mothapo said.
