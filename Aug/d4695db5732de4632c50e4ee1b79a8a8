Polokwane Municipality issued a notice to inform the public that a planned power outage is scheduled for this weekend in order to allow for the re-routing of cables from the temporary 11 kV switching station to the newly built Thornhill 11kV switching station.
According to Communications and Marketing Manager of the municipality Matshidiso Mothapo, the work will be carried out on Saturday and Sunday between 08:00 and 16:00. This will affect a part of Eagle’s Nest in Bendor Extension 95 on both days and Waterberry in Extension 91 on Sunday.
“All users are urged to treat all electrical circuits as live during the re-routing to avoid injury and damage. The municipality apologises for the inconvenience and will appreciate the patience and cooperation of all,” Mothapo said.
