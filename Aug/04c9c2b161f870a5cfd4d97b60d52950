After realising that most learners miss prom nights due to financial constraints, Good Samaritan Fortunate Makamu is on a mission to collect matric dance dresses for Grade 12s who cannot afford to purchase one.
The 26-year-old candidate attorney from Lebowakgomo initiated a campaign called ‘Take a girl child to a matric dance’ to collect as many dresses, shoes and jewellery as possible for learners from impoverished families. This initiative is part of her Thutelopele Foundation which assists matrics to apply for bursaries and space at various institutions of higher learning. The campaign aims to assist 30 learners enrolled at Lebowakgomo High School, Phauwe Secondary School and Kgapane High School. Thus far, Makamu collected 20 dresses.
She indicated that during her matric year some of her friends could not attend the matric dance because they couldn’t afford to buy a dress. “This triggered something in me and I told myself that I would establish a foundation to assist learners. We are going to lend learners the dresses, shoes and jewellery free of charge. The campaign is not only limited to assisting female learners hence we call upon boys who can’t afford a suit to get in touch with us. After the ceremony, learners are requested to bring back whatever they had borrowed for other learners to use in the future,” Makamu explained.
She further highlighted that the foundation was initiated last year and they have assisted five learners to further their studies at university level while the campaign was initiated this year. She added that they also render motivational talks, mentorship and coaching and pleaded with academics to join the foundation to groom youth into better people.
