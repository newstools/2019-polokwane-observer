Chairman of First Touch Academy, a female soccer team in Polokwane Mmowa Kekana has congratulated his charges for winning the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games Tournament held in Soweto last Saturday.
The academy thrashed Tshwane University of Technology Female Soccer team 2-1 in the finals of the tournament.
Banyana Banyana striker Noko Matlou scored each goals in the first and second half of the match. For their endeavours they walked away with gold medals and R35 000 in cash prize.
Congratulating the squad, Kekana said the feat has set a good tone for them ahead of the upcoming national women’s football league set to commence in August. “We were using the tournament to prepare the girls for the league and they showed hunger and readiness,” Kekana remarked.
He also added that they needed to double their efforts at the league in order to justify their inclusion. “It is new league altogether and we have to impose ourselves well. We will be representing the province. We don’t want to falter or add numbers we want to compete and eventually win the league,” Kekana added.
