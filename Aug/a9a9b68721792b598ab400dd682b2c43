Forty local golfers took to the greens during a club challenge played at Polokwane Golf Club on Saturday.
Dudley Venner proved that he was on top of his game when he finished first with 33 points. He was followed by Jacques Pretorius on the second spot after accumulating 33 points. The jackpot lucky draw was made at holes one, five, six and ten but none of the golfers managed to get their hands on the 1 350 units that were payable on the day.
