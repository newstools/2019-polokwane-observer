Members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in Limpopo marched to various government departments to hand over copies of a memorandum of grievances during the union’s Provincial Day of Action yesterday (Wednesday).
During a media briefing at the union’s headquarters around noon on Monday, Nehawu Provincial Secretary Jacob Adams highlighted some of their demands contained in the memorandum. These included calling for the heads of Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba and Limpopo Director General Nape Nchabeleng.

Adams stated that an increased number of unemployed social workers and health professionals in the province was a major concern for its negative impact on service delivery.
According to Adams, the Department of Social Development has trained 2 155 social workers across the province and absorbed 1 112 while some 721 are without jobs and 211 are on an internship programme funded by the Department of Health and Welfare Seta and 180 are on a contract with the Department of Education. He further said the shortage of health workers in public hospitals and clinics were a nightmare and yet the Department of Health still couldn’t hire about 440 unemployed professional nurses who are unemployed.
Adams concluded by saying the march was directed to the Departments of Health, Social Development, and Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure, Provincial Treasury and Premier’s Office.
