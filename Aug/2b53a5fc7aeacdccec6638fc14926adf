Mrs Polokwane 2019 Charlene Geswind handed over a donation of R20 000 to Stop Trafficking of People (STOP) team member Ndoza Javu in the city on Monday.
Geswind explained that Pansolutions recently donated R34 000 to the Mrs Polokwa­ne 2019 non-profit company and that R14 000
was used to host the Date Night with Mrs Polokwane 2019 event that was hosted at Protea Hotel Ranch Resort on Saturday evening. “I have decided to donate the balance of R20 000 to STOP because of the incredible work that they do for the community,” Geswind said.
STOP team member Ndoza Javu said STOP is a non-profit organisation and will make good use of the donation. “Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal industry with millions of people trapped over the world. They are used in ways that include sexual exploitation, forced or bonded labour, forced marriages and organ harvesting,” she said.
