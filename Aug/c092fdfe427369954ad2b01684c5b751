Consumers may experience water shortages over the weekend due to a planned electricity outage affecting the Ebenezer Water Scheme.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said in a media release earlier today (Wednesday) that the municipality has received notice of a planned power outage from Lepelle Northern Water that will affect the Ebenezer Water Scheme from 08:00 to 16:00 on Saturday. This is due to conductor and pole replacements by Greater Tzaneen Municipality, Mothapo indicated.
The scheme will not be pumping water to Polokwane and all areas of supply, including Segwashi, Mentz, Mankweng, the city and Seshego will be affected.
Mothapo added that water supply will be restored once the work is done. Polokwane Municipality will provide regular updates in terms of any developments.
“The municipality urges all to use water sparingly and further apologises for the inconvenience,” Mothapo concluded.
