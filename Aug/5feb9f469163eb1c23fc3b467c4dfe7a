The situation in Mokopane is reportedly calm this morning (Friday) after a group of protestors had gathered outside the Mogalakwena municipal offices yesterday, demanding the resignation of Mayor Andrina Matsemela.
The unrest follows the alleged assassination of two prominent African National Congress members Vaaltyn Kekana and Ralph Kanyane last Wednesday, reportedly related to faction fights within the municipality’s political structures.
“The Police is ready to deal with incidents that may occur when a march to the local Magistrate’s Court that is planned for 11:00 today, takes place,” SAPS Provincial Head of Communications, Motlafela Mojapelo said. Mojapelo also confirmed that both Minister of Police, Bheki Cele and his deputy, Cassel Mathale visited the town yesterday and met with stakeholders.
Telephones at the municipality remained unanswered this morning and an official reached at home, informed that all staff were on leave. Reports on social media reflect that most businesses in the town are closed and that children are not attending schools.
