Meropa Casino and Entertainment World, in keeping with their International Mandela Day activity programme last Thursday called on its employees and volunteers from local businesses to rise against hunger with the result that a total of 55 000 meals were packed and readied for donation to various charity organisations in the province.
The initiative, in collaboration with Rise Against Hunger, saw volunteers invest 67 minutes of their time in manning packaging lines at Meropa to pack meal parcels for children in need. Information made available to Polokwane Observer highlighted that Meropa Casino was one of eight Sun International properties to participate in the Rise Against Hunger food packing drive this year. This is the fourth consecutive year that Sun International has supported this worthy cause, it was learnt. In the past three years, Sun International has helped pack over 5 million meals at its properties with the help of volunteers from local businesses.
It was further reported that food parcels packed at Meropa were distributed to Baswane Drop-In Centre in Ga-Molepo, Mafiwa Drop-In Centre in Moletji Kanana, Ranoto Drop-In Centre in Mmotong, Morwakola Drop-In Centre in Ga-Mashashane, Mmakoma Drop-In Centre in Botlokwa, Sekgakgapeng Drop-In Centre and Mogalakwena Football For Hope Centre both in Mahwelereng and Dithabaneng Drop-In Centre in Ga-Mphahlele.
