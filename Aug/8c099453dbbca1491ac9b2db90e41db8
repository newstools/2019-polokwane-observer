Former Mopani District Executive Mayor Joshua Matlou was officially sworn-in as the African National Congress (ANC) Member of the Provincial Legislature (MPL) during a ceremony at Parliamentary Village this morning (Thursday).
The swearing-in of Matlou follows the resignation of Lehlogonolo Masoga as an MPL in the first session of the sixth Legislature term. Matlou took the oath in front of his new colleagues, family and friends while guided by the Speaker of the Legislature, Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya. He said the experience and knowledge he acquired during his time as the ANC councillor would come in handy and pledged to do anything in his power to carry out the responsibilities he is entrusted with.
He thanked the ANC for entrusting him with the role and his family for their continued support. Masoga resigned with immediate effect yesterday (Wednesday) while Matlou started with Legislature duties after the swearing-in ceremony. Read full story in next weekâ€™s edition of Polokwane Observer.
