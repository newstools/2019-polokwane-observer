Consumers could expect water shortages and low pressure later today (Tuesday) due to maintenance work necessitated by vandalism of the water infrastructure from the Ebenezer water plant.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo reported earlier this morning that Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) has stopped water supply from the Ebenezer scheme. “The scheme has been stopped due to repairs on a leak that was allegedly caused by acts of vandalism,” Mothapo said.
“All areas of supply will be affected. It will take over five hours to repair the leak and water will take a while to reach affected areas after the repairs are done,” Mothapo added.
Mothapo urged consumers in areas where water is available to use the commodity sparingly.
Communications Officer of LNW Simon Mpamonyane could not be reached on his mobile phone and Maphure Manamela of the SAPS Provincial Communications Unit confirmed that no case of vandalism has been registered as yet.
