The first State of the Province Address (Sopa) of the sixth Legislature to be delivered by Premier Stan Mathabatha in the Legislative Chamber in Lebowakgomo tomorrow (Friday) would cost the Provincial Legislature at least R2 million as compared to R2,5 million spent for the previous occasion at the Jack Botes Hall in February.
This is according to the Speaker of the Legislature, Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya during the pre-Sopa media briefing at Parliamentary village yesterday (Wednesday). She indicated that moving Sopa to the Legislature would save them about R500 000 as they will cut on equipments hiring costs, catering as 500 guests are expected as compared to 1 500 guests that were catered for during the previous address.
She went on to highlight that invited guests are not going to receive welcome gifts this time around as this was one aspect that contributed to a higher budget. Mathabathaâ€™s address is anticipated to set the tone for provincial government service delivery for the sixth administration and also outline the key strategic objectives for the next five years.
Lerule-Ramakhanya urged residents who cannot make it to the venue to be in front of their television screens as the addressed would be televised. She concluded by saying guests at the venue will be taken care of and protected as law enforcement agencies and emergency medical services are ready to tackle any issues that might arise.
