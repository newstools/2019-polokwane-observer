A 30-year-old woman is expected back in the Bela-Bela Magistrate’s Court on 19 August on charges of child neglect. This after she was arrested last Tuesday following the Police’s discovery of her 12-year-old disabled daughter chained to a chair in a locked room.
Provincial Police Spokeperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the woman already appeared in court last Thursday and was granted bail of R500 but remanded as she could not pay the amount.
Concerned community members reportedly notified Police about a child allegedly not being treated well by her mother and often being locked in alone inside their house.
Ngoepe informed that upon investigation Police officers found the girl chained to a chair in a locked room. They immediately took the necessary steps to ensure the child’s safety and arrested the mother.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba commended members of the community who informed the Police about the situation.
