Great North Transport (GNT) has expressed regret at actions taken by bus drivers affiliated to Trade and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Tawusa) who blockaded certain roads in the city centre yesterday (Wednesday).
Patrick Monkoe of the company’s Marketing and Communications Division in a press statement said the company views the illegal strike and inconvenience to users and businesses in the city in a serious light and has commenced with various internal processes to ensure such behaviour is uprooted from the company. “GNT does not condone the action at all as it happens against the spirit of the Recognition Agreement the company has with the union,” Monkoe said.
“Whilst the unions have to raise disputes, it was not necessary for Tawusa to embark on such illegal action, creating havoc on the busy streets of the city putting the lives of people and other users at risk. On behalf of management and the board the company unreservedly apologises for the inconvenience caused,” GNT Chief Executive Officer Sandile Keswa was quoted to have said.
The thirteen affected buses were impounded by law enforcement officers and interventions and efforts are being put in place to ensure their release soon.
