Dennis Mashele (36), a security officer employed at Dithabaneng Mine outside Lebowa­kgomo is expected to apply for bail in the local magistrate’s court today (Thursday) in connection with an incident during which a learner was fatally wounded during community protest action near the mine last Wednesday.
According to Marobo Seabela of the Provincial Police Communications Centre the suspect already appeared in court on Monday after which the case was postponed for bail application and further investigation.
His arrest follows an incident near the mine when 18-year-old Boshelo Petja was allegedly shot during community protest action and later succumbed to his injuries in hospital.
Seabela indicated that Police immediately started with investigations which revealed that conflict erupted between the security guards and community members and shots were allegedly fired which led to the death of the learner.
Mashele was arrested two days after the incident.
