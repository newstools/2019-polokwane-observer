Black Leopards Football Club on Monday acquired the services of former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates defender Thabo Matlaba.
Matlaba who has 27 international caps with Bafana Bafana joins Lidoda Duvha after spending eight seasons with the mighty Orlando Pirates.
Club pokesperson, Berry Ramunenyiwa described Matlaba as one of the best defenders in the country with a wealth of experience. “We are happy to have him in the club. He is a fantastic, versatile player who can also play in the middle of the park. He will definitely add value in the team and also serve as inspiration for young players,” Ramunenyiwa said.
He also added that they have signed former Free State Stars and Richards Bay Football Club midfielder Abubakar Mumuni on Friday. “He is also a quality player, very strong and he will also help us in competing for silverware next season. We are not done, we are still negotiating with other top players in the country. Remember we did not change the team last season, we played with the players that were in the National Fisrt Division with us in 2017. This season we want to be in the top 5 and the only way to achieve that goal is to have top quality players in our arsenal,” he concluded.
