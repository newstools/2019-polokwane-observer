A 23-year-old suspect was expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on a charge of fraud after he was arrested by members of the Limpopo Hawks Serious Commercial Crime Investigating Unit on Monday.
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that the suspect allegedly bought a vehicle worth R300 000 from a local dealership on 3 April by submitting fraudulent payslips and bank statements to have the deal approved.
A case was opened with the Hawks and investigation led members to Kwaggafontein Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga where he was appearing in a separate case on Monday. He was arrested and the vehicle recovered, according to Maluleke.
