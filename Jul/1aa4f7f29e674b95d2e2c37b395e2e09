Consumers may expect water shortages and low pressure tomorrow (Thursday) due to maintenance work on water infrastructure providing water from the Krugersburg reservoirs next to Ster Park.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo reported earlier today (Wednesday) that a planned water supply shutdown will affect the Central Business District (CBD), Bendor, Ster Park, Serala View and Flora Park tomorrow.
“This is due to repairs that will take place on leaking 800 mm and 500 mm steel supply pipes from the Krugersburg reservoirs between 07:30 and 16:00. Water supply to the affected areas will be restored once the repairs are completed,” Mothapo said.
Mothapo urged consumers to use water sparingly and responsibly and apologised for any inconvenience caused.
