Business in Zone 1, Seshego’s was affected this morning (Monday) when residents embarked on protest action over water and electricity tariffs ahead of a shut-down planned for Wednesday.
Although the protest was somewhat peaceful, residents blocked a road next to the shopping complex with burning rubbish. The protest forced shops and the municipal office to close. It was reported that the protest was a resolution from a community meeting held a day prior.
African National Congress Ward 13 Branch Executive Committee member, Masilo Manthata indicated that the complaints included wrong billing and expensive electricity. He further said it was a community protest and residents threatened to chase away municipal officials working in the area for the municipality to attend to their grievances.
Economic Freedom Fighters Ward 13 Deputy Chairperson Willy Makgoba stated that the incident was a wakeup call to the municipality and added that they were planning to draft a memorandum and apply for a march. He went on to stress that a total shut down was planned for Wednesday in Seshego.
Polokwane Municipality spokesperson Matshidiso Mothapo emphasised that they had not been made aware of residents’ grievances and that the municipality woud respond to residents accordingly once the queries were made available. Mothapo indicated that the increase in tariffs was guided by service providers such as Eskom and Lepelle-Northern Water, adding that the municipality was forced to increase the tariffs once the service providers do so to be able to provide residents with water and electricity. He urged residents to approach the municipality to address their issues for them to be dealt with.
