With drug abuse and gangsterism seemingly on the rise in schools across the country, a group of actors in the province created a stage play called ‘Your choice’ to try and discourage harmful behaviour among youth.
The play had a three day run at the City Library auditorium and was attended by, among others, Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka. It was learnt that the show is based on gangsterism and drug abuse in schools. Director Thabang Ramabu indicated that they intend using the play to discourage young people from engaging in criminal activities and taking drugs. He further said their wish is to get the show across the province and even abroad to spread the message.
Moraka highlighted that her department supported the initiative because it talks to the creative industry in the province – particularly the arts space. “We must give our youth an opportunity to be exposed to the industry for them to make a meaningful life out of the creative industry by showcasing their God-given talent. The play sends a message to young people about the dangers of harmful substan­ces. There is a lot of learners in schools who engage in nyaope and drug related issues hence we are here to support the message,” she explained.
She further said the creative industry was one of their mandates that talks to outcome 13 of the National Development Plan which addresses issues of social cohesion and nation building. She added that it was her department’s mandate to give artists the necessary support they deserve for them to make a living in sectors such as film, fashion and music. Moraka concluded by saying the department will continue to give artists both moral and financial support for them to flourish and represent Limpopo with pride.
