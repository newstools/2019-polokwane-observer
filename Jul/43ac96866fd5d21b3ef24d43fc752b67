Members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in Limpopo are anticipated to paint the city red when they march to various government departments to hand over copies of memorandum of grievances during the union’s Provincial Day of Action on Wednesday.
During a media briefing at the union’s headquarters around noon today (Monday), Nehawu Provincial Secretary Jacob Adams highlighted that some of their demands included calling for Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba and Limpopo Director General Nape Nchabeleng’s heads. He stated that an increased number of unemployed social workers and health professionals in the province was a major concern which has a negative impact on service delivery.
According to Adams, the Department of Social Development has trained 2 155 social workers across the province and absorbed 1 112 while some 721 are without jobs, 211 are in an internship programme funded by the Department of Health and Welfare Seta and 180 on contract with the Department of Education. He further said the shortage of health workers in public hospitals and clinics was a nightmare but the Department of Health still cannot hire the nearly 440 professional nurses who are unemployed.
The march is set to commence at 09:00 from the Polokwane Hospital Park situated between Plein and Magazyn streets. Adams concluded by saying the march was directed at the departments of Health, Social Development, Provincial Treasury, Premier’s Office and Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure.
