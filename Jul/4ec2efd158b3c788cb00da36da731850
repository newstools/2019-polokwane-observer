After delivering the first State of the Province Address (Sopa) of the sixth Legislature in Lebowakgomo on Friday, Premier Stan Mathabatha can now look forward to the anticipated criticism from political opposition parties and individuals.
Although there were no disruptions during the address, Economic Freedom Fighters Provincial Chairperson Jossey Buthane was somewhat not happy with the fact that the African National Congress member of the provincial legislature Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana was allegedly sleeping in the house during the Sopa. Buthane stood on a point of order and indicated that the sixth administration had a long way ahead and that it was unacceptable for Mokaba-Phukwana to sleep on the job.
Ahead of the address, a group of learners from various schools in Ga-Mashashane staged a silent protest next to the Legislative chamber holding placards with their demands, which included access to clean water and proper infrastructure and eradication of pit latrines in schools across the province. The learners, affiliated to Equal Education, indicated that the exercise was to remind Mathabatha of the hiccups experienced by learners in schools.
Mathabatha’s address highlighted budgets that are set aside for different projects such as the construction of low cost housing, Limpopo Academic Hospital and an arts theatre for the province, roads and special schools. Creation of jobs and improving the local economy were also some of the topics that were covered during the address as Mathabatha indicated that they would boost agricultural, tourism and mining projects to help fight unemployment.
