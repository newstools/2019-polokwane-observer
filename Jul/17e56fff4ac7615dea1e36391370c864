One of four suspects allegedly involved in robbery at a shopping complex in Bur­gersfort was killed during a shoot-out with Police on Monday morning.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the other three suspects were arrested on the scene.
This follows a sting intelligence-led operation conducted by operational teams from Limpopo and Mpumalanga including the tracking team, the intervention unit and the Burgersfort K9 Unit.
Ngoepe remarked that the suspects, allegedly involved in a robbery during which an undisclosed amount of money was stolen, were intervened and pulled off the road by Police officers at Ga-Masha Village.
One of two confiscated firearms.
The suspects immediately started shooting at the officers who retaliated and subsequently fatally wounded one of them. His fellow suspects were apprehended and their vehicle, two firearms and a bag containing money confiscated.
The identity of the deceased, the origin of all the recovered items and possible connexion of the suspects to other criminal activities in the area are still being investigated.
The three suspects, aged between 25 and 31, were expected to appear before the Sekhu­khune Magistrate’s Court earlier this week facing charges of business robbery, possession of prohibited firearms and ammunition and possession of suspects’ stolen property.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Le­dwaba has warned criminals who continue with their dubious acts that they will meet the full might of the law.
