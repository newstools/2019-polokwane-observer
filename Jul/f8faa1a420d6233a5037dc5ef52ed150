Two suspects were expected to appear in court during the course of the week in connection with an incident at Burgersfort when angry community members allegedly attacked members of the Public Order Policing (Pops) Unit on Monday.
National Police Spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo condemned the attack which was filmed and is currently trending on social media.
Members of Pops were reportedly responding to a complaint of possible vigilantism at the Burgersfort Magistrate’s Court when they came under attack from an angry, violent mob. The complaint was that the mob had arrived at the court demanding that two alleged murder suspects be handed over to them, according to Naidoo.
A female officer was allegedly dragged on the ground and assaulted followed by the Police being pelted with stones. No serious injuries were reported but the female officer sustained minor injuries, according to Naidoo.
He added that the Police initially withdrew as per standard operational procedure, averting what could have resulted in an even more disastrous situation and then used stun grenades to disperse the crowd.
“Given the circumstances our members handled the situation very professionally, taking into consideration that many lives could have been lost if the Police adopted an offensive approach,” National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole was quoted to have said.
Sitole called for the severest punishment permissible by law should should the suspects be found guilty.
