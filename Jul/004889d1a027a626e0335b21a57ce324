The Limpopo Academic Hospital is seemingly becoming reality as all stops for construction of this 488-bed facility have been pulled out to ensure that it will commence during this financial year.
In his State of the Province Address delivered on Friday, Premier Stan Mathabatha described the planned Limpopo Academic Hospital as one of the massive infrastructure projects currently being implemented in partnership with the National Department of Health.
“The construction work for this multi-phased project will commence in this financial year. The Minister of Finance has since allocated a budget of R3,9 billion to this project,” Mathabatha announced.
The hospital will provide tertiary care for the province and will be the major teaching hospital for the University of Limpopo Faculty of Health Sciences and School of Medicine.
The site for the hospital has been identified as between the N1 bypass and Webster Street.
Consultants have been appointed to undertake the scoping and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process and the draft scoping report will be available for inspection at the Administration Building Reception in the A Block of the Edupark Campus, as well as at the Polokwane City Library from tomorrow (Friday) until 12 August. It can also be downloaded from the consultant’s website at http://www.nemai.co.za/environmental.html.
Spokesperson for the Limpopo Department of Health, Neil Shikwambana confirmed that the National Department of Health is the implementing agent and advised Polokwane Observer to source further information from the National Department. Attempts to obtain more information from the department at deadline time were unsuccessful.
