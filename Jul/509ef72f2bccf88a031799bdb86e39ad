Proper training is key when it comes to preparing for the Comrades Marathon and if you want to attempt next year’s ultimate human race, you can start training as early as next week.
Mzansi Athletics Club coach Lufuno Mudau has issued an invite to all athletes who wish to participate in the 2020 Comrades Marathon to gather at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday at 17:15 to pledge their commitment in running the Comrades next year.
Club Chairperson Richard Rambiyana said Mzansi Athletics Club together with Lufuno introduced the Couch to Comrades Programme three years ago and it has since proven to be very successful.
The programme offers quality training for social runners who wish to enter the Comrades as novices next year as well as for professional athletes who wish to improve the level of performance and time, according to Rambiyana.
“We will help you to achieve your dream,” Rambiyana said.
