The province’s grannies soccer club, Vakhegula Vakhegula will soon be honoured and celebrated by the provincial government after thrashing France’s grannies football team 10-0 during a recent international friendly match and returning home with two trophies and gold medals.
Premier Stan Mathabatha in a statement said the heroines should in due time receive a befitting welcome in their home province and that the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture would soon announce the plans. Mathabatha said he was overwhelmed by the talent from his province dominating the international stage and further congratulated the team for their efforts.
The match was played during the 2019 Fédération Internationale de Football Association Women’s World Cup in France. Vakhegula came home last Monday with two trophies, one for winning the game and another presented to them in recognition of team founder Beka Ntsanwisi for a job well done in keeping grannies’ football active.
Ntsanwisi thanked the grannies for representing the country and Limpopo with distinctions and added that the team would start with preparations for matches against Japan, Poland and Germany scheduled for next year.
She further stated that her wish was to host a mini-grannies’ world cup in Limpopo in 2021, an initiative for which France have already pledged their support. Ntsanwisi concluded by saying arrangements for the planned mini-world cup would be communicated in due course and pleaded for the support from the provincial government, companies and individuals.
