Following the resignation of Mopani District Municipality Municipal Manager (MM) Republic Monakedi on Tuesday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo came forth with claims alleging that Monakedi contributed towards the downfall of the municipality.
DA councillor in the same municipality Marie Helm claimed in a statement that Monakedi’s dreadful legacy contributed to a massive growth of outstanding creditors. The money owed to creditors currently stands at R1 billion and seemingly no plans exist to stop the growth of creditors or to reduce the amount, Helm alleged. She went on to claim that Monakedi failed dismally to improve on the Adverse and Disclaimer audit opinions which the municipality has obtained since 2014. He further failed to improve the sloppy performance reports from different directorates, she stressed.
“Under his helm various committees have on numerous occasions lamented the municipality for lacking the basic ability to keep reliable financial and administrative records. The DA will fight to ensure that he is not redeployed to another government position as he is clearly incapable,” Helm explained and concluded by urging municipal Mayor Pule Shayi to prioritise the matter and ensure that the position is filled with immediate effect in order to accelerate service delivery.
Mopani District Municipality spokesperson Witness Tiva confirmed to Polokwane Observer that Monakedi had tendered his resignation on Tuesday and will officially conclude his duties as MM at the end of the month. Tiva further said the municipality would convene a special council sitting in due course to process Monakedi’s resignation and subsequently appoint an acting MM. On claims made by the DA, Tiva emphasised that “We describe the DA’s allegations as cheap politicking and grandstanding. If the DA was unhappy about Monakedi’s leadership it was supposed to use internal processes to raise its discontent as it is part of council.”
