Officials from the Office of the Tax Ombud (OTO) concluded their week-long activation campaign in the city this morning (Monday) when Tax Ombud Bernard Ngoepe addressed tax practitioners and interested members of the public at a breakfast session at Fusion Boutique Hotel.
Ngoepe emphasised that taxpayers have legitimate expectations that their money will be spent fairly. “They should not pay one cent less than they have to pay but should also not pay one cent more than they should. It destroys the tax morale of the public,” Ngoepe said.
Ngoepe concluded to say that the services of the OTO are free of charge and that the aim of the campaign was to inform taxpayers about the rights that they have to escalate their tax challenges to the OTO after it could not be resolved with SARS.
