Four suspects believed to be part of a crime syndicate were expected to appear in the Tzaneen Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week after they were arrested during an operation in the area on the weekend.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the suspects are believed to have been responsible for a number of robberies involving hitchhikers in Tzaneen, Makhado and Mankweng recently.
Ngoepe reiterated that members of the Crime Intelligence Unit, tracking team and detectives as well as private security companies and Community Policing Forum joined forces after information about a Volkswagen Golf reportedly involved in the said crimes was spotted in the town centre of Tzaneen on Friday.
The BMW with no licence plates was among the confiscated vehicles.
The driver of the Golf was arrested within minutes which in turn led Police to Lenyenye outside Tzaneen where the operation continued. Police spotted a BMW with no licence plates which had reportedly been involved in similar criminal activities
Police tried to pull the vehicle over but the driver sped away and Police gave chase, according to Ngoepe. Police managed to corner the suspects in a village outside Lenyenye where they abandoned the vehicle and fled into the bush. Police continued their pursuit until the three suspects were apprehended.
Ngoepe said both vehicles, 14 cell phones and items of suspected stolen clothes were confiscated.
Provincial Police Nneke Ledwaba has commended the team for a meticulous job done in apprehending the suspects.
