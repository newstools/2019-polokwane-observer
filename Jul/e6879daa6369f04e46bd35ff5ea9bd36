Quick response by Police resulted in the recovery of a Volkswagen Polo belonging to one of its members which was allegedly hijacked at Mabokelele outside Moletji last Tuesday.
Mienkie Ramakgoakgoa of the Provincial Police Communications Centre said the constable, attached to Seshego Police Station, was on his way home in Moletji when he decided to stop by a friend who lives at Mabokelele.
She said it was around 20:00 when he arrived at his friend’s place. While still sitting in the car an Audi approached. Four armed persons emerged from the vehicle and demanded his car keys.
They forced him out of the Polo and a shot was fired into the ground before the suspects fled the scene with the constable’s vehicle, two cell phones, driver’s licence, wallet with bank cards and cash, according to Ramakgoakgoa.
Police were notified and swiftly responded subsequently locating the vehicle outside Botlokwa within hours.
No arrests were made yet and anyone with information can contact investigating officer Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or report to the nearest Police station.
