A memorial service for African National Congress (ANC) veteran and former freedom fighter Ike Maphoto is under way in Polokwane as family and friends have joined ruling party structures to bid farewell to one of their own.
Maphoto, an erstwhile Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) member who later on was elected to serve as Member of the Legislature for two terms, passed away on Saturday at the age of 88.
The memorial service programme that is currently being conducted is allowing for a tribute by ANC Provincial Chairperson and Premier Stan Mathabatha and a keynote address by ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a special official funeral to be held in Polokwane on Sunday.
