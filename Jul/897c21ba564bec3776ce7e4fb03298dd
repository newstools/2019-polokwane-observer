Former Bafana Bafana defender, Siyabonga Zulu is training with Black Leopards Football Club.
In the hope of securing a contract ahead of the start of the Premier Soccer League (PSL).
Zulu was reportedly fired by the PSL champions, Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club last season after he allegedly missed a disciplinary hearing after he failed to report to duty.
The 25-year-old previously played for Chippa United Football Club and Platinum Stars Football Club.
Black Leopards’ trials were attended by, among others former Free State Stars keeper Olivier Kwizera from Rwanda and former Baroka and Polokwane City Football Club, defender Thabiso Semenya.
Semenya who hails from Moletjie area played 21 matches in all competitions for Baroka and helped them to win their maiden Telkom Knockout Cup last season.
He was also part of the Platinum Stars squad that won the MTN8 cup in 2013.
Club spokesperson Barry Ramunenyiwa confirmed that the players started training with the club on Monday. “They are training with other players and at the moment we can say if we will sign them or not.”
According to sources Zulu and Semenya will add value in the club given their local and international football experience. “Leopards mean business this season they don’t want to fight relegation again. They want to stay in the PSL forever. They have already signed Thabo Matlaba and Thuso Phala, both seasoned players with international caps. Nothing beats experience and I hope they sign all the players especially Zulu because he is still young and he will give them lot of options in defence.”
