Final year Optometry students at the University of Limpopo (UL) offered free eye screening and counselling to visually impaired learners attending Makeketela Primary School at Ga-Kama village, Ga-Mamabolo last Thursday as part of the Department of Optometry’s community outreach programme.
Lerato Segwati, lecturer in the department was quoted to have explained that one of the mandates of the university is to empower and offer services to the community. “As such, we assisted the learners with any vision impairment using case history, visual acuity, cover test, pupillary examination, ocular motilities, refraction, accommodative test and ocular health, while offering possible recommendations where necessary. Visual impairment can affect the learners negatively, and if not detected early, lead to poor performance.”
Segwati reportedly also said the Optometry students detected impairment symptoms including hyperopia (farsightedness) among the students and made recommendations for treatment at the nearest health facility.
