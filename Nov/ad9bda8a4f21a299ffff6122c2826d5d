Police are investigating a case of murder and has opened an inquest docket following the death of a Police sergeant who was allegedly shot and killed by her husband before he reported turning the gun on himself at their home in Tzaneen on Saturday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Yvvone Moyana (43) was a communications officer attached to the Tzaneen Cluster while her 44-year-old husband was employed at the Provincial Crime Intelligence Unit.
The motive for the incident is still being investigated and Mojapelo was only able to confirm that the incident apparently happened in front of the couple’s three children who were immediately taken for trauma counselling.
Mojapelo did not reveal the husband’s identity and the publication was still awaiting his name at the time of going to print.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba as well as Tzaneen Cluster Commander Maggie Mathebula visited the scene and condemned the incident.
“The South African Police Service has internal structures that provide assistance to members who might be going through any strained domestic issues and members are urged to make use of these structures,” Ledwaba reportedly said.
