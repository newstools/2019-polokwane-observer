Grade 7 learners of Pietersburg Comprehensive School (PCS) gave their imagination free reign last Friday when they ditched their school uniform to dress up as they would when practising their dream careers.
The occasion was the school’s annual career day for its senior learners and the enthusiastic group came dressed as doctors, pilots, police officers, traffic officers, nurses, soccer players, entrepreneurs, lawyers and engineers. Educators were on hand to discuss different careers, give guidance and answer the learners’ questions. Makosha Matseba, educator at the school, said they aimed to create a platform to make learners aware of different career paths and to guide and inform them as to what career choices are all about.
“It is important for us as educators to create such initiatives and help them to shape their career paths at an early age. They are leaving our school this year to go on to secondary school where they wills soon have to make career related choices. We wish them all the best in their future endeavours,” Matseba said.
