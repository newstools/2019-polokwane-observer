With the Festive Season fast approaching, Polokwane Police are aiming to intensify visibility in the city centre as this time of the year is normally characterised by an increase in criminal activities.
This was evident during a foot patrol last week in the central business district which not only saw officers combing the streets joined by Polokwane Police Commander Gift Makhubele and Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba who took time to interact with community members.
Polokwane Police Spokesperson Lesiba Ramoshaba indicated that foot patrols in the city are conducted on a regular basis. “We were honoured to have Makhubele and Ledwaba joining us last week. We were also joined by other crime fighting structures as well as the community safety department of the Polokwane Municipality,” he said.
Ramoshaba indicated that the aim of foot patrols was to increase visibility and to create awareness among community members about certain crimes such as theft, theft out of motor vehicles and cell phone thieves which are synonymous with the area.
It was learnt that several people were searched and some were found to be in possession of dangerous weapons and dagga.
One person was also found in possession of a gas pistol and a variety of shops were visited and warnings issued.
Ramoshaba could not at the time of going to print provide exact figures on how many arrests were made.
