In their bid to advance in the 2019 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season, Baroka Football Club acquired the services of former Bafana Bafana lethal striker Prince Nxumalo last Thursday.
Nxumalo has scored 36 goals since turning professional in 2012. He played for Golden Arrows, Super Sport United, Bidvest Wits and Ajax Cape Town Football Club.
The 29-year-old from KwaZulu-Natal is expected to score and create goals for Baroka who has thus far only amassed eight points from nine matches of the league.
Club spokesperson Mogau Maredi said Nxumalo will contribute immensely to the club. “His inclusion in the team is part of our efforts to strengthen our striking force. We welcome him in the Baroka family.”
