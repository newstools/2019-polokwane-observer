Players from three of the provinceâ€™s Premier Soccer League clubs, Baroka, Polokwane City and Black Leopards reported to their respective camps last week following a three week Fifa international break.
All three clubs dropped crucial points in their last matches and they will be hoping to win more duels before the Christmas break.
Baroka, at present hovering in the relegation zone of the league, will face the resurgent Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Sunday.
Black Leopards will host the high-flying Golden Arrows Football Club at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Polokwane City who fired their coach Zaltko Krmpotic two weeks ago will lock horns with the high flying Maritzburg United at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on 8 December.
