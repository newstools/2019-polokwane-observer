More than 500 learners from various schools around the city were guests during a Christmas party hosted at Mitchell House on Saturday.
The young guests were treated with breakfast, snacks and lunch to ensure that they had enough energy to take part in the fun and games on the water slides and jumping castles. A military band provided entertainment while the learners enjoyed iced cool drinks, cookies and fruit juice on the pavilion.
Mitchell House Bursar Godfried Kruger said that the food and refreshments were provided by businesspeople from the community as well as individual donors. “It was a privilege for Mitchell House to reach out to the schools in this way,” Kruger said.
