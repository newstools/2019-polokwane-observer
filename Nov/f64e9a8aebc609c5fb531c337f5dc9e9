Polokwane City Football Club parted ways with their head coach, Zlatko Krmpotic on Friday.
Krmpotic joined the club at the beginning of the season in August but could not deliver the desired results. He leaves the club in the 10th position of the log with four victories from 11 matches.
A statement released by the club on Friday reads: “It is with regret that we announce the departure of Zlatko Krmpotic as the head coach of Polokwane City Football Club. Despite the best efforts of the club, the head coach and all parties involved with the club, recent results on the field of play have unfortunately not gone in our favour. This has prompted the club and the head coach to reconsider the position of Zlatko as the head coach of the club. In the circumstances, pursuant to a meeting between club chairperson Johnny Mogaladi and the head coach it was agreed, in the best interest of the club, that the club and head coach part ways in an amicable manner. Accordingly, the parties have signed a mutual termination of their contract of employment with immediate effect. As of this morning, Zlatko has been relieved of his duties and is no longer the head coach of Polokwane City FC,” the statement read.
Chief operations officer of the club Tincy Tema said Bernard Molekwa, assistant coach of the club will be at the helm until they find a success for Krmpotic.
