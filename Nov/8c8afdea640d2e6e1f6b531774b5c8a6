Last week Polokwane Police yet again moved into the city in an effort to address criminal activities in the central business district.
Police continue to maintain visibility in Polokwane and keep focussed on certain crime-generating elements such as drugs.
A suspect who was caught red-handed stealing the spare wheel of a bakkie.
According to information several suspects were arrested for being in possession of dangerous weapons as well as car-breaking equipment.
A knife and alleged jamming device were found in possession of the suspect.
So-called car-jamming remains problematic in the city centre as well as at certain shopping complexes, according to a source.
Two suspects were arrested for being in possession of gate remote control devices generally used to jam the function of a vehicleâ€™s remote control. One suspect who also had a knife in his possession was apprehended in Excelsior Street while another was nabbed in Gen Joubert Street for being in possession of a jamming device.
The source also indicated that the stealing of spare wheels, especially from bakkies, has become a common crime in the city.
One suspect was arrested in the parking area of a shopping complex after being caught red-handed stealing the spare wheel of a bakkie. The source advised that bakkie owners should secure their spare wheels with extra locks and chains underneath the vehicle if necessary.
