A grant sponsor monitoring team from the Rotary Clubs of Marburg and Marburg Schloss in Germany recently visited the Thusanang Training and Development Centre near Haenertsburg to gain first-hand knowledge of developments at the centre that were funded by a Rotary International Global Grant.
Local Rotarian Heinz Haas, who was one of the hosts of the group said that the fruition of the grant was due to the hard work of Bernhard Maisch and the efficient and very time consuming hard work of preparing the grant proposal to Rotary International by Peter Stuart-Thompson, ably and skilfully assisted by the Director of Thusanang, Terry Morgan.
According to Haas, the team arrived ahead of time and were met and greeted near the intersection of Paledi Mall. “After welcoming the group we took them to Paledi Mall for cool drinks – a new experience for them!”.
“Locals Terry Morgan and Anne Luther met us and to everyone’s amusement took us to a funeral parlour where 21 Thusa­nang practitioners were receiving training and guidance in the art of making teaching materials for the pre-schools. It was amazing to see the transformation of toilet rolls into butterflies and bees. Many pictures were taken displaying both Rotary clubs logos and a Haenertsburg Club tear drop. Our German guests were clearly impressed with what they saw at this training session,” Haas related and added that the visitors also visited some other interesting activities.
“Later, after settling into their hosts’ home, our guests were taken to our Rotary meeting where Bernhard Maisch gave a very interesting talk about Marburg where he was Dean of the Medical Faculty in one of Europe’s oldest universities.”
