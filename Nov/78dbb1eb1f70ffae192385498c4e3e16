A group of residents claiming to be from Seshego were forcibly removed from the council chamber during a special meeting of Polokwane municipal council earlier this morning (Monday) after they insisted to address Executive Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng.
The protesters did not disclose details of their grievances and were ordered by Speaker of Council Mariri Ralefatane to leave the chamber and after refusing, officials from the municipalityâ€™s security services were ordered by Ralefatane to remove the group of approximately 20 people from the chamber.
The leaders of the group were then taken to the municipal offices where an undertaking was given that Nkadimeng will meet with them on a date to be advised, according to one of the protesters who wished to remain anonymous.
