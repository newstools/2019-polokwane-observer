Learners at Northview Christian Academy were treated to a colour run at the school’s sport grounds recently.
This was a platform for learners to have fun ahead of the final examinations that commenced last Monday and will conclude on 25 November.
Participants had to run to four colour stations being blue, green, red and purple to be splashed with colours by their educators. Stalls that sold sweet treats added fun to the occasion.
Educator Lizellé Coetzer said this was the second event with the first one having been hosted in 2017. She indicated that they wanted learners to have fun before they sit for the exams and reiterated that they were planning to host the event annually. All the learners in school were part of the colourful occasion and excitement could be seen on their faces.
