Fans of Charlie’s Angels enjoyed gifts and refreshments in the foyer of SterKinekor in Mall of the North before they attended a pre-screening of the trio’s latest movie last Wednesday evening.
Gin and tonic or dry lemon and lighter non-alcoholic drinks were served while guests nibbled on fruit skewers with cucumber and cheese before they received decorated pink glasses and gift vouchers.
Starring Naomi Scott, Sam Claflin and Kristen Stewart, the story is an action comedy about three women who are working in a private detective agency and when a young systems engineer blows the whistle on dangerous technology, Charlie’s Angels are called into action, putting their lives on the line.
One of the guests, Lynn-Marié Combrink said that she took advantage of the opportunity to have an entertaining getaway with her friend, Marian Jordaan while her husband Hennie attended to their two toddlers. “I am a fan of Charlie’s Angels and have not missed any story in the series since it was released years ago,” Combrink said.
