Issues revolving around quality education, housing, healthcare, job creation, the crime rate, poverty reduction, investor confidence and economic growth were up for discussion when recently instated Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) President Velenkosini Hlabisa and his national executive contingent touched down in Polokwane on visit to Limpopo last week.
It was learnt that the first stops on the three-day itinerary planned for Hlabisa and his leadership would have been to venues in Thohoyandou, Tzaneen and Jane Furse as they were about to embark on a “fierce interaction programme with ordinary people in the streets of Limpopo, in taxi ranks and malls”. The Limpopo visit was believed to grant people of all backgrounds the opportunity to engage with the party’s president on what the IFP had to offer in South Africa’s political landscape and why to vote in its favour.
Hlabisa and his national leadership arrived with the clear message of a commitment towards addressing the needs and issues of the people of the province, as explained in an early morning media session. Asked about the focus on solidifying the party’s presence in the province, he further said they wanted to firmly establish their base in Limpopo.
In addressing service delivery issues and concerns affecting the lives of ordinary South Africans, Hlabisa elaborated on the success stories in municipalities where the IFP was governing, when governing KwaZulu-Natal and the impact made in communities. He remarked that they were building more schools in terms of classrooms, clinics, hospitals and Police stations than the ruling party government had done since 1994. He concluded indicating that they could give reference in terms of the party’s track record when given the opportunity to govern in a particular area.
