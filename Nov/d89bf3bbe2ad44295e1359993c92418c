While most South Africans were watching the Rugby World Cup mountain biking enthusiasts battled it out in the annual Insect Science Classic mountain bike challenge at Stanford Lake College on Saturday.
Claiming victory in the 70 km for men was Alan Gordon with a time of 2:57.39.
Gordon added the victory to his list after winning the gruelling Crocodile Trophy mountain bike race in Australia under a month ago. CP van Wyk (3:01.45) finished just over four minutes later to take second, while Rory Button, almost eight minutes back, came third.
Sarah Hill savoured a maiden victory in the race when she finished in 3:17.06. According to the organisers Hill stayed on her own after the second climb of the day and was able to maintain her advantage to take the win over Sanevey Scriven (4:11.38) by nearly one hour. Dorothy Rood finished more than half an hour later to take third.
In the 45 km event junior rider Armand Cronjé (1:47.02) claimed a tight victory over Dawie Grobbelaar with youth riders Tyrone Anders (1:47.05) and Bjorn Nel both finishing within seconds after Cronjé.
Veteran rider Retha Beukes finished the 45 km women’s event with a time of 2:21.46 leaving second and third place open to Amilia Goosen (2:21.54) and Jana de la Port.
The 18 km saw Michael Scriven (0:53.04) and Ali Thomson claiming the honours in the men’s and women’s races respectively while Johanno van Tonder and Lohané Ehlers came out tops in the 10 km ride.
