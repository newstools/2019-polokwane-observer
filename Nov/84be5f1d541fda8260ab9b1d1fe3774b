Police investigations and a manhunt for suspects continue following an incident at Savannah Mall on Saturday during which a woman was allegedly robbed of a large amount of money.
According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo a couple who had withdrawn money from a bank in the mall had allegedly just gotten into their vehicle in the parking when they were approached by two gun wielding suspects.
According to him shots were fired but no one was injured and the cash as well as the woman’s handbag were stolen after their vehicle’s window was broken.
The money was allegedly withdrawn for the purpose of buying a vehicle, according to Mojapelo.
Savannah Mall Manager Karen Botha indicated that no shots were fired during the incident and that one suspect allegedly used the gun to break the window of the vehicle. According to her it was also not a couple but a woman alone.
She added to Mojapelo’s warning that shoppers should be more vigilant, especially with the Festive Season approaching.
“Shoppers should at all times avoid withdrawing or carrying large amounts of cash. Avoid leaving valuable items such as cell phones, laptops, cameras and wallets in vehicles,” Botha warned.
She added that the mall has security measurements in place to ensure the safety of shoppers to their greatest capability.
Anyone with information on the matter can contact Const Maake on 079 897 9033 or report to the nearest Police station.
