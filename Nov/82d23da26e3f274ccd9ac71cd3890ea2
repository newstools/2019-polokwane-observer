Members of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) were still in the offices of Lepelle Northern Water at 11:00 this morning (Monday) after it was raided.
“We were all ordered out of the building when the SIU arrived at our offices and officials of the SIU started to remove documents and equipment from the building,” LNW Spokesperson Simon Mpamonyane confirmed.
Democratic Alliance (DA) Provincial Leader Jacques Smalle said in a media release that the raid follows alleged corruption in relation to a R3,5 billion bulk water infrastructure project in Giyani. “For the past eight years, 50 villages around Giyani have had no clean drinking water. Currently residents have to walk for up to 5 km to carry contaminated water back to their houses,” Smalle said and added that allegations of corruption and irregular expenditure plagued the project from the start.
Enquiries regarding the raid were referred to the acting Communications Manager of the SIU, Sefura Mongalo. Mongalo, however, was not available for comment.
