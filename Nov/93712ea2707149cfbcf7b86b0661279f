PEPPS Preparatory School recently hosted its friendly swimming gala that afforded learners from various schools in the city an opportunity to hone their skills and techniques while at the same time engaging some of their opponents in a non-competitive environment.
The guest schools were Mitchell House and Pietersburg English Medium Primary School (Pemps) as well as Mankweng Swimming Academy. The gala was conducted in good spirit and excellent sportsmanship was shown by all the swimmers throughout the contest.
The swimmers had a fun day competing and no results were captured.
