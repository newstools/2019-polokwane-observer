Educators at Northview Christian Academy continue to enhance their knowledge and teaching skills. Eight educators received Level 5 Early Childhood Development diplomas during a graduation ceremony that was held at Agape Church on Saturday. They commenced with the course last year January and completed in June this year.
They said they were among a group of educators who enrolled with EduExperts and remarked that while the course was not a walk on the park but rather challenging they would nevertheless continue with their studies. The group intends to enrol for level 7 qualifications in 2021. Educators James Rutherford and Charlene Pieterse received trophies after being named top students for Phalaborwa and PoloÂ­kwane respectively.
