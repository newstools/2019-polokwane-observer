Two male suspects were expected to appear in the Maake Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week on charges of conspiracy to commit business robbery, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and possession of a dangerous weapon after they were arrested late last week.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the suspects were nabbed at about 20:15 as they were about to rob a pizza outlet at a local shopping complex.
The arrests followed a sting operation after information was received about the suspects and their intentions, according to Mojapelo.
He added that members of the provincial Crime Intelligence Unit and Tracking Team, detectives, K9 Unit and the Maake Visible Policing Unit followed the tracks of the suspects until they were spotted in close proximity of the franchise.
Police quickly cornered the suspects and recovered a 9 mm firearm of which the serial number has been filed off, four rounds of live ammunition and an okapi.
