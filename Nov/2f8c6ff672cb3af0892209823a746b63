Meropa Casino and Entertainment World intends rolling out the red carpet for Limpopo’s A-listers who are expected to attend the finale of the 2020 Miss and Mr Limpopo Pageant on Sunday.
The event will run from 12:00 until 18:00 and will see Charmaine Nkosi crowning her successor.
The finalists of the Miss Limpopo Pageant are Ntiyiso Mabunda, Mma­thema Kgomo, Coenita Valoyi, Kanyisa Mabaso, Tintswalo Khoza, Kamogelo Kwapa, Temana Masipa, Matsatsi Mametja, Pontsho Mailula, Takalani Ramarumo, Shirley Ramoroko, Nkateko Kubaye and Rethabile Mojapelo.
The inaugural Mr Limpopo pageant will be contested by Kemisho Tsatsi, Nathan Foster, Kgaledi Letsoalo, Duncan Mhlongo and Benjamin Maila. Event organiser, Matlakala Bopape said it is now all systems go for the event.
“It has been an exciting five months searching for models and putting the event together. We are happy to have come this far. We have a group of inspiring and exciting young men and women whom we believe are capable of winning the title. We are looking for a role model, someone who will speak to the youth about socials ills, the rampant scourge of domestic and gender-based violence and that individual will be crowned on Sunday,” Bopape said.
Tickets for the event can be purchased at R450 each from House of Asante, 29A Jorissen Street Polokwane.
