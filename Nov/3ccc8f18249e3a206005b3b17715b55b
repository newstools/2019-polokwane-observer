Polokwane Executive Mayor, Thembi Nkadimeng last Tuesday launched the annual Mayoral Charity Golf Day that will be hosted at Polokwane Golf Club tomorrow (Friday).
Nkadimeng thanked the 15 sponsors for their pledged support. “The money will go towards the Mayoral Bursary Fund that supports students who are capable of progressing academically but lack financial resources. The municipality also supports some non-governmental institutions,” Nkadimeng said.
The municipality’s Sport and Recreation Manager, Mantlako Sebaka said around 140 players are expected to take part in the event.
