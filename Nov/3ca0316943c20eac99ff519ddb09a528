Although Ntuli was not certain as to exactly when Mutheiwana tendered her resignation but indicated that it had been submitted to Mathabatha and was being processed. Ntuli could not divulge the reason for Mutheiwana decision to resign as the matter was still between employer and the employee.
She indicated that reasons would be made public as soon as the matter has been finalised.
