A total of 107 school-leavers at Gen Piet Joubert School were treated to a special farewell function at the institution recently.
Learners charmed the crowd when they arrived at the venue in extravagant vehicles while dressed in fashionable suits and gowns. The celebration was to bid the group farewell as they were expected to leave the school after writing their last examination paper last Friday. These learners are equipped with skills that include panel beating, motor mechanics, woodwork, plumbing, needlework, food production and hair care among others.
Principal Daniel Mapiti indicated that the school was proud of the group as he encouraged them to go out there and represent the institution well. He further said they should be ambassadors of Gen Piet Joubert School and concluded by wishing them well in their future endeavours.
