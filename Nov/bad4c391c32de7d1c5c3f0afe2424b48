Local beauty and businesswoman, Jacqueline Ferns was crowned Tammy Taylor Mrs South Africa at a gala event at Emperor’s Palace in Gauteng on Friday evening.
Ferns walked away with a brand new Suzuki Vitara, a Tammy Taylor franchise, other gifts and a bag full of vouchers and will leave for Las Vegas in the USA on 28 November where she will take part in the Mrs World competition.
Ferns says that she is looking forward to the global competition. “Although I have taken part in a number of South African competitions, the USA event will be my first global participation,” Ferns says. She was not sure about the prizes to be won but indicated that winning the coveted title will be enough. “I am sure that my business, Ace Models and my students will benefit from the experience and accolades that I have acquired so far,” she reckoned.
