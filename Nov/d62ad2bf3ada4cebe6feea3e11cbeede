Erol Akbay has resigned from his position as the head coach of GladAfrica Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzhivhandila after only a month.
The Netherlands-born mentor joined the Venda based outfit in October to replace Moma Medic who was fired by the club in September.
Akbay was previously at the helm of Zimbabwean Premier Soccer League clubs Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders.
Chief executive officer of the club, Sello Chokoe said Akbay resigned last week and former Black Leopards striker, Lucky Nelukau has been appointed as interim coach.
Chokoe said they were shocked by Akbay’s resignation.
“He told us that he was unhappy with the club’s operations and he had decided to resign. We have gone back in the market to look for another coach and we are receiving calls from agents every day. We intend to appoint in January and we are looking for a coach that has a good reputation and excellent credentials. Someone who has won league titles and promoted clubs before,” Chokoe said.
