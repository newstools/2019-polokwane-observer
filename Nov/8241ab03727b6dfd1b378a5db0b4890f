Police have launched a search party for 17-year-old Mavis Manikie Tsheoga and who was allegedly kidnapped in Elandskraal in the Marble Hall area by an unknown suspect driving a silver grey BMW on Tuesday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the girl and her 15-year-old sister, Rancia Tsheoga were hitch-hiking to school when a person in a BMW allegedly stopped and offered them a ride to Lepelle High School.
The suspect allegedly drove to a secluded spot and produced a firearm. He reportedly tied both girls, used his jacket to cover their faces and then drove to an unidentified location where he reportedly forced Mavis into a house and locked her up, according to Mojapelo.
He added that the suspect allegedly then drove with Rancia to Ga-Molapo village in Magatle outside Zebediela where he dropped her off, untied her and gave her money for transport back home.
The Police were notified about the incident and a search operation ensued. At the time of her abduction Mavis was wearing school uniform consisting of a blue shirt and grey skirt.
Two cases of kidnapping are being investigated and anyone with information can contact investigation officer Salome Lebelo on 082 414 6674 or report to the nearest Police station.
