Mrs Polokwane finalist Bronwynne Tomes-Adonis donated non-perishable food items, toiletries and Bibles to men who are currently undergoing rehab at Khuluma Ed-diction Drug Rehabilitation Centre in Ivydale on Friday.
She said the items were some of the centre’s major needs and that such centres are crucial in the society to help those who are battling drug addiction. She added that the organisation which at present caters for 15 men is not subsidised by government hence she saw a need to reach out to them. Tomes-Adonis also recently embarked on a sanitary towel drive and managed to collect over 1 000 packs.
She was assisted by a financial institution, a grocery store, members of Westenburg V-Dub Crew and individuals in her community to collect the sanitary towels and items donated to the drug centre. She indicated that the sanitary towels were donated to women at Ext 44 and female learners at Westenburg Secondary School who cannot afford such items. Tomes-Adonis emphasised that it was important for individuals and companies to help those who can’t afford to purchase basic necessities.
