Dancers from Melisa Gilfillan Dance Academy took the opportunity to show their skills during the academy’s year end recital and prize giving that was hosted at Mitchell House on Saturday.
Owner Melisa Gilfillan said the event served to celebrate the students’ hard work of the past year. “Students performed their dances done at the Limpopo Eistedfodd in May, Cecchetti examinations during September and the Cecchetti Performance Awards in Roode­poort and received certificates and medals according to their examination results,” Gilfillan said and added that the 54 children who participated in the Cecchetti Ballet exams won 19 distinctions (gold), 28 merit (silver) and 4 passes (bronze). Seven children were chosen to perform at the Cecchetti Performance Awards held in the Roodepoort Theatre where four girls won the trophy for the overall best junior performance.
