National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in Limpopo claims Premier Stan Mathabatha is not keen on fighting corruption as he allegedly took months to suspend his spokesperson, Kenny Mathivha who was reportedly found guilty of submitting irregular travel claims.
Nehawu Provincial Secretary Jacob Adams argued that although the union welcomes the suspension, they are just concerned that it took Mathabatha many months to implement the resolutions taken during a disciplinary hearing that happened about four months ago. Adams indicated that the disciplinary committee resolved that Mathivha should pay back the money and be subjected to suspension.
Adams reminded that when Mathabatha took office he pronounced that he would fight corruption but that this refutes his undertaking to do so. “Mathabatha should have acted immediately after the hearing process if he was really keen on fighting corruption. Mathivha was aware of the legislation in terms of travel claims but he decided to do otherwise. He paid back between R400 to R500. It doesn’t matter how little the money is. Corruption is corruption and perpetrators must face the music,” Adams stressed and concluded by highlighting that Mathivha was on two months suspension without pay.
Acting provincial government spokesperson, Mamogo Ntuli confirmed on Monday that Mathivha has been suspended for two months, from 1 November until the last day of the year. She said he had gone through a formal disciplinary process chaired by an external chairperson.
It was learnt that Mathivha’s suspension was related to alleged irregular travel claims he submitted early in the year.
At the time of going to print, Ntuli had not answered phone calls or responded to text messages to clarify as to exactly when Mathivha was served the suspension notice and whether he would be remunerated in full while being suspended.
