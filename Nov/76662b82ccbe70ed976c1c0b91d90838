Residents and learners from four schools in Myngenoegen came together to clean the area during a recent initiative hosted by Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (Wessa) Friends of Polo­kwane Nature Reserve.
Learning institutions that participated were Pepps Preparatory School and College, Curro Heuwelkruin Independent School, Eagle’s Nest Christian School and Myngenoegen English Private School (Meps).
Wessa Chairperson Lisa Grosel indicated that this was their first campaign and reiterated that she was excited that schools and the community embraced the idea. She said they will be raising funds to print banners to discourage people from littering. She added they will be running a competition where participating schools will receive concrete dustbins for them to design. The school with the best designs will be crowned the winner, Grosel explained and went on to add that another contest will be based on recycling to encourage schools to make money out of rubbish and an institution that raised more money through recycling will also win the title.
She applauded residents for taking time off their busy schedule to support the initiative by providing tools and vehicles to transport rubbish. Grosel also thanked schools for allowing learners to get dirty for a worthy cause.
