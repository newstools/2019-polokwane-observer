The Multi Diski Challenge (MDC) coach of Polokwane City Football Club, Bayano Moloto asserted that it would take time for his players to adapt to the new format of the challenge imposed by the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in August this year.
Moloto commented after their 2-3 loss against their counterparts Baroka Football Club in their 14th match of the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.
City this season has only managed to win two matches from 14 competitive matches of the challenge.
Moloto admitted that it has been a tough season for him and his players.
According to the new rules of MDC only players under the age of 21 are eligible to play in the challenge. “One of our downfalls is that we don’t have development leagues in the province hence we are struggling against teams from Gauteng and other provinces. They have all developmental formats the u.15, u.17 and u.19 which is a good platform to unearth talent. Most of the players in our team are from rural areas and some have never played on such a big stage. It is a new challenge for them. However, we are adamant that they will learn, adapt and grow,” Moloto said.
He said with only 16 matches to go they can still qualify for the Shield Cup which is contested by the teams that finish the challenge in the top eight bracket.
MDC is a youth development programme that includes a football tournament for the PSL clubs, life skills and leadership development for players.
