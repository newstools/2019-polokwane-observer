The Department of Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs (Coghsta) is currently preparing documentation to inform Mogalakwena Municipality of MEC for Coghsta, Basikopo Makamu’s decision to place the municipality under administration in terms of section 139(1)(b) of the Constitution.
When making the announcement during the Provincial Members Assembly of the South African Local Government Association (Salga) in Bela-Bela last Wednesday, Makamu said that this step should not be seen as a punishment as it aims to restore effective local governance.
Spokesperson for the MEC, Molebatsi Masedi said on Tuesday that the intervention aims to return the municipality to normal functioning of good governance and accountability as well as sustainable municipal services. The intervention will also focus on the restoration of confidence of the community and inspire investor confidence and realise the benefits of mining for the municipality and the community and business in the area.
Masedi said that the first step in the process is now to issue a notice to notify the municipality of the intention to apply Section 139(1)(b) and allow reasonable time for the municipality to consider the notice. “We are confident that the municipality will agree and thereafter the steps to be taken will be guided by the Rapid Assessment Report on Focus Areas that was compiled by the multi-discipline team consisting of Coghsta, different directorates, the Provincial Treasury and the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency (Misa),” Masedi said and added that the report was a fair and objective assessment that will provide focused intervention.
Masedi explained that the intervention will focus on governance, the council, and subcommittees such as the Municipal Public Accounts Committee, audit, risk, performance and general accountability.
