Polokwane Municipality alerted consumers that a planned shutdown of supply from the Olifantspoort water treatment works is scheduled for tomorrow (Wednesday) from 07:00 until 15:00 and that it may affect supply to all areas of the city.
According to spokesperson for the municipality, Thipa Selala, pumping will be interrupted to allow for the installation of a high lift pump. “The pipe lines will be empty during the operation and normal supply will only be restored after the reservoir levels have rehabilitated,” Selala advised and appealed to consumers to use water sparingly.
