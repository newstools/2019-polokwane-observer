What has been seen on a regular basis in Polokwane the past few months will become an even more common phenomenon as the Festive Season approaches and law enforcers tighten the net to rid the city’s roads of drunken drivers.
This weekend law enforcement action resulted in the arrest of 18 drivers found to be driving under the influence of alcohol.
The operation was conducted at various locations across the city by Polokwane Police as well as members of the Polokwane Municipality’s traffic department.
Motorists are warned that a zero-tolerance attitude will be maintained throughout the Festive Season towards people driving under the influence of alcohol.
