The venue at Sun Meropa was filled to capacity when the orchestra and choir of University of Limpopo (UL Choristers) treated classical music aficionados to a choice of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Shalati Joseph (SJ) Khosa on Saturday evening.
The theme of the event was ‘SJ Khosa meets W A Mozart’ and the repertoire included ‘In praise of brotherly love’, ‘Yehova I murisi wa mina’ and ‘O Yesu Murandziwa’ by Khosa and ‘Dixit Dominus KV339’, ‘Batti, Batti O Bel Massetto’ and ‘Un’aura amarosa’ by Mozart.
Some of the guests of honour were Principal and Vice-Chancellor of UL Mahlo Mokgalong and former Chancellor of the university, Reuel Khoza who is a keen supporter of the UL Choristers and have produced some of its award winning performances.
Mokgalong welcomed the guests and said that music is the food of love. “It is also the food of war, of strife and of battle. But ‘SJ Kosa meets W A Mozart’ is about love, not war,” Mokgalong said and congratulated the conductor and maestro-par-excellence, Thabe Matsebatlela and his orchestra and choir on a bold initiative to bring Mozart and Khosa to Polokwane.
“I trust we will all enjoy a memorable evening of kindred spirits in a convivial environment,” Mokgalong concluded.
Khosa was born in Malamulele in Limpopo in 1936 and has composed more than 800 songs and more than 70 hymns before he passed away in 2013. Mozart only reached the age of 35 and composed over 600 works in his lifetime.
