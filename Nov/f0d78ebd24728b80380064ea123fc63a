Nearly ten business owners and managers in the liquor industry such as taverns, liquor outlets and restaurants pitched for a meeting with Polokwane Police which was scheduled for Tuesday at the Polokwane Police Station.
The meeting aimed to address issues relating to liquor in the city and for business people to pledge to the #We Will Comply Campaign.
The campaign focusses on liquor traders to comply with the terms and conditions as set out in the Liquor Act.
Traders were informed and asked to always ensure that their liquor license is displayed properly, to renew their licenses before the expiry date, to comply with the conditions of the license, to adhere to trading hours and not to sell alcohol to minors or to allow drunkenness on the premises. It was learnt that the premises of those who attended will be visited in duo cause and they will be issued with a compliance certificate once all the boxes are checked.
