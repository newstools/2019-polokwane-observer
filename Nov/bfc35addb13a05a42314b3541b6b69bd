Learners at Share Joy Pre-School were over the moon when surprised by Santa Claus who handed out presents at the institution last Thursday.
Principal Josephine Kagori indicated that this was an annual celebration to reward learners for the hard work and dedication shown throughout the year. She further stated that children were treated to sweeties and mouth-watering dishes after receiving the gifts.
Kagori thanked the parents and guardians for entrusting the school with the future of their children and appreciated them for the support they gave the institution. She went on to applaud educators for a job well-done and thanked them for being great teachers and parents to all the learners.
