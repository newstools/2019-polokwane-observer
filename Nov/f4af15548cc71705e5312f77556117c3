Premier Stan Mathabatha has joined President Cyril Ramaphosa and the country in celebrating the Springboksâ€™s 32-12 victory over England in the finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan to lift the William Webb Ellis Trophy on Saturday.
Mathabatha reportedly said they cannot keep quiet as a province because one of the best rugby players, Trevor Nyakane who was part of the Springboks squad is from Limpopo. He further stated that through the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture thousands of Limpopo people were able to watch the Springboks sail to the number one spot on the big screen across the province.
Ahead of the big match, the provincial government in partnership with SABC Limpopo hosted a
motorcade activation to rally behind the national rugby team as they were preparing to confront England. The motorcade started Olympic Towers to SABC Park and then proceeded to Mall of the North.
