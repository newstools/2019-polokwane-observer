After a series of charity campaigns, the ten Mrs Polokwane 2020 finalists are gearing up for the finale scheduled for Saturday at Bolivia Estate.
Although the pageant is not about prizes but reaching out to less fortunate people in communities, the beauty queens now have their sights on the title. The Mrs Polokwane organising committee recruited strong and independent married women who have a zest for community upliftment.
The Mrs Polokwane Organisation is a non-profit company that supports other non-profit organisations in the province. Thus, through various individual and collective fundraising initiatives Mrs Polokwane 2019 titleholder, Charlene Geswind, together with her finalists handed over a total of R59 370 to various charity organisations.
The finalists were successful in having blanket drives, sanitary towels hand over, Cansa Polokwane awareness workshop, autism awareness campaign, boy-child matters workshop, youth motivational talk, handover of toys and clothes, installation of a 12-month Wi-Fi and a visit to Polokwane Society For the Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals.
The highlight of the journey is the Mrs Polokwane gala evening set to start at 18:00 at Bolivia Estate on Saturday.
Tickets are available at a cost of R450 per person which will include a two course meal, lots of entertainment and an entry to stand a chance at winning a five-day jewellery making training programme with Limpopo Jewellery Incubator.
