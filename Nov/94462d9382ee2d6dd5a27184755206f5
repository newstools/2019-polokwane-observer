Polokwane Police joined by crime fighters attached to Mighty Tactical Reaction Service arrested a person suspected of having been involved in a recent robbery in Tzaneen, at a fuel station on the N1 just outside Polokwane last week.
The suspect was reportedly found to have been in possession of three suspected stolen cell phones which are seemingly linked to an incident in the neighbouring town recently.
According to information a tip-off about the suspectâ€™s presence at the fuel station resulted in law enforcers being dispatched to the area to observe.
Within minutes the suspect was traced and apprehended. He was taken to a local Police station to be charged.
At the time of going to print Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe had not responded to any queries about the matter despite being provided with a case number.
