Mrs Polokwane finalists Sandra Nkwe and Modjadji Baloyi hosted the ‘Be awesome for autism’ awareness seminar at Nirvana Hall on Saturday.
The gathering was aimed at making people aware of the autism disorder spectrum for them to be more involved in children’s lives, become caring and understanding. Baloyi indicated that many people don’t understand the intensity of autism. She reiterated that she has a friend who has a child who has autism while her counterpart, Nkwe also has a friend who has a child with autism, which is why they decided to host an awareness drive.
According to Baloyi, the disorder is mostly dominant in boys hence they wanted to educate people. In most cases children with autism can’t speak but can hear, she explained. She was not happy with the turnout at the gathering but added that they were delighted with the small group that did turn up.
She indicated that Autism Limpopo also attended the session and educated the audience. Parents of children with autism also gave their story on everyday challenges they face with raising an autistic child and achievements. Baloyi recently handed over a cheque of R7 270 to Cansa Polokwane in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
