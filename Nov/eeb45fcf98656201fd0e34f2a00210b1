PEPPS Preparatory School and College Executive Head Annabel Roberts reminded learners to always keep in mind that they are capable of achieving anything in life that they set their minds on. She stressed that the institution strives to make children strong on the inside and shape them into future leaders. At PEPPS every child is precious, she remarked as she encouraged parents to make time to talk to their children in order to be aware of their challenges and interests.
