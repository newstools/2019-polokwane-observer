Golfers were caught between a rock and a hard place at the Polokwane Golf Club on Saturday when they had to choose between contesting in a golf tournament and watching the 2019 Rugby World Cup final between the Springboks and England.
Participants painted the golf course green and gold in support of the national rugby team that was crowned the world champions after defeating England 32-12. Ahead of the big game, golfers locked horns on the greens with hopes to outcompete their opponents to emerge victorious. Results of the competition were still awaited by the time of going to print.
