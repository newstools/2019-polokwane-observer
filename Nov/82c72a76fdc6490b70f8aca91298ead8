Local chefs and food producers were afforded a platform to network, share skills and information during the Global Entrepreneurship Week 2019 culinary show and competition hosted by Polokwane Municipality at Nirvana Hall last Thursday.
Emerging food producers displayed various products that included cooking appliances, juice, traditional tea and vegetables at their stalls while chefs revealed their best skills in the kitchen. Although the event was not that well attended, participants were spotted exchanging information and business cards.
When officially opening the gathering Polokwane Municipality Director for Planning and Economic Development, Hyven Kholophe indicated that chefs and food producers create the much needed jobs in the province. He stated that entrepreneurs in the food sector were somewhat privileged because people consume food everyday. Kholophe reiterated that PoloÂ­kwane Municipality will do its best to assist the sector in any way possible for the industry to flourish and continue to create jobs.
He added that the culinary show and competition was mainly for businesspersons in the food sector to network and share information. He appealed to role players to support the food sector for the industry to grow and contribute to the local economy.
