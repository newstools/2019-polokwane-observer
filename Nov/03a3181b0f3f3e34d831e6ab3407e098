As law enforcement operations in the city continue on a daily basis it became evident that PoloÂ­kwane Police will not leave any stone unturned in their effort ensure a crime free Festive Season.
Last week Police members were seen closing in on contractors at a well-known estate in the city where at least 30 illegal immigrants were arrested.
According to information a tendency by contractors to hire illegal or undocumented migrants as labourers has over the past months created a problematic situation. Apart from the fact that being in the country illegally is a criminal offence the situation further acts as a crime generator especially with regard to housebreakings, according to a source.
Alleged illegal immigrants employed as construction workers are removed from one of the sites.
Labourers sleeping on construction sites at night creates a possible hazard should these workers get injured. Half-built houses are also used as hiding spots for criminals which resulted in Police taking action and removing the suspects.
It was learnt that several construction sites were visited resulting in the arrest of 15 illegal immigrants on the first day and more the following day bringing the total number of suspects being apprehended to 30.
The city centre was once again turned upside down last week as a wave of men and women in blue joined by law enforcers from the Polokwane Municipality took to the streets to interact with residents and to address criminal activities on the spot. Several fines were issued to motorists for, among others, obstructing traffic and failing to stop at a red traffic light.
Police also targeted prostitutes in Bok and Dahl streets and at least six suspected sex workers were arrested.
