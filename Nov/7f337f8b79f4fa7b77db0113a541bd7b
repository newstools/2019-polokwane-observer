The investigation into a contract to provide water to communities around Giyani may soon be completed after the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) raided the offices of Lepelle Northern Water early on Monday morning.
SIU Spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed that the SIU conducted a search and seize operation after a court order was obtained to allow the SIU access to the building and seizure of documents and computers. “The investigation started more than two years ago and it was revealed that the value of the original contract was R900 million, but that more than R2 billion was paid to the contractor,” Kganyago said.
“An interim report was already submitted to President Ramaphosa and it is apparent that the contract was illegal and in contravention of supply chain legislation and regulations. We will now approach a court of law to have the contract nullified,” Kganyago added.
LNW Spokesperson Simon Mpamonyane confirmed the raid. “We were all ordered not to enter the building when we arrived for work on Monday morning,” Mpamonyane said and added that LNW will cooperate with the SIU to bring the investigation to conclusion.
