Residents of Centenary House visited Zanna Bird and Reptile Park last Wednesday to learn more about different types of snakes.
The enthusiastic bunch had the opportunity to touch and pose for mementos with some of the non-venous snakes.
Sharing extensive and educational insight on the carnivorous reptile, Elijar Sebola, snake handler at Zanna Bird and Reptile Park told residents that snakes don’t smell with their noses like humans but use their forked tongue to smell and taste chemical compositions in the air.
He said snakes live in almost every corner of the world and are found in forests, deserts, swamps and grasslands. “They give birth to live young, much like mammals,” Sebola said.
He further advised the visitors not to kill snakes if found in their homes or yards but rather all a snake catcher or handler for assistance. “Snakes are dangerous and expertise is needed to catch them. We are in the rainy season and rain is known to bring the snakes out since they will be chasing after frogs and rodents. We are likely to see the number of snakes increasing in various areas be it backyards and bushes. If you see a snake, call us and we will deal with them,” Sebola advised.
Rita Groenewald, Personal Assistant to the APD Director thanked the establishment for hosting the residents. “They had fun. They enjoyed touching the snakes and learning more about them,” Groenewald said.
