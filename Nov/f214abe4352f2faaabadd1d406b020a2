With more than 90% of all households in Makotse Village outside Le­bowakgomo depending on a monthly income of R800 or less, the Makotse Women’s Club has taken it upon themselves to uplift and empower rural communities.
Founder of the club Maria Mello said they decided to form the club to curb the scourge of poverty in the area.
“My village was plagued by a high poverty rate, teenage pregnancy and low life expectancy until we intervened. I consulted three friends and together we came up with the idea of establishing a community development project.”
The club started out as a small gardening project in 1994. Ten years later their efforts were acknowledged when Mello became a finalist in 2004 Shoprite Checkers/SABC 2 Women of the Year competition.
Today the club incorporates a thriving crèche, a bakery and a drop-in centre for orphans and vulnerable children in the village.
Their one-hectare garden is maintained by 40 villagers and has the potential to successfully run four hectares of vegetable production.
It daily provides nutrition and economic stability to the Makotse community.
As a business with heart, the Shoprite Group, together with its implementation partner Food and Trees for Africa, took hands with the Makotse Women’s Club.
In addition to planting seedlings, Shoprite also provides permaculture training, gardening equipment and fixed the existing water system, which resulted in the club producing enough vegetables to not only feed the community, but also to sell and in this way generate an income.
