Police are investigating a case of armed robbery after a couple was robbed of a large amount of cash at Savannah Mall yesterday (Saturday).
According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo it is alleged that the couple had just gotten into their vehicle in the parking area after withdrawing money from one of the banks at the mall when they were reportedly approached by two gun wielding suspects.
Shots were fired but no one was injured and the cash as well as the woman’s handbag were stolen after their vehicle’s window was broken.
The money was allegedly withdrawn for the purpose of buying a vehicle, according to Mojapelo.
He warned that as the Festive Season is approaching, community members should avoid carrying large amounts of cash.
Anyone with information on the matter can contact Constable Maake on 079 897 9033 or report to the nearest Police station.
