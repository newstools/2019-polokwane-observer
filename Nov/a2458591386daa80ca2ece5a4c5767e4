Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs (Coghsta) MEC Basikopo Makamu announced at the Provincial Members Assembly of the South African Local Government Association (Salga) in Bela-Bela yesterday (Wednesday) that Mogalakwena Municipality has been placed under administration in terms of Section 139(1) of the Constitution.
Makamu said this intervention should not be seen as a punishment as it aims to restore effective local governance. He added that the outcome of a forensic investigation was being awaited.
Although the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Limpopo welcomed the decision, party Provincial Chairperson Jossey Buthane expressed disappointment that the African National Congress (ANC) had to wait for all the damages and pain caused to the residents of Mogalakwena by their leaders and deployees before they could act. He claimed that illegal and unlawful decisions by the Mogalakwana municipal council are the order of the day and further alleged that public funds were being stolen and money has been spent without being budgeted for, hence violating the Municipal Finance Management Act.
“The EFF challenges the ANC to put Limpopo Provincial Government under administration because government departments, state entities and municipalities continue to grapple with corruption, fruitless and wasteful expenditure as well as irregular expenditure each financial year,” Buthane stated.
