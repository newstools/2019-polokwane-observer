Department of Health has once again managed to shorten the waiting period for 97 patients in line for orthopaedic operations in public health institutions in the province.
The department managed this through its quarterly Orthopaedic Outreach programme ‘Letsema’ where a group of orthopaedic specialists working in other provinces dedicate a weekend to operate on orthopaedic patients as their way of ploughing back to communities. It was learnt that the group was led by Steven Matshidza, Head of Clinical Department at the University of Free State. Departmental Spokesperson Neil Shikwambana indicated that the operations which were performed include hip replacements, ankle open reduction and internal fixation among others. The team is expected to return again early next year to perform more operations, he stated.

Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba reportedly said the programme is a critical build up to the festive season: “The festive season is upon us and road accidents will produce more patients who would need these kinds of operations. It is important for us to deal with the backlogs ahead of the festive season.”
According to Shikwam­bana, the Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize visited some of the patients at Tshilidzini Hospital who shared their touching stories. Mkhize reportedly met with Matshidza and conveyed his message of appreciation. He said the department was humbled by this selfless act of humanity.
