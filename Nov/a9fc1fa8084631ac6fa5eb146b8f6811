PEPPS College Grade 10 learners got together to complete their annual ten hours of community service for their Life Orientation lesson by refurbishing Dorothy Langa Primary School in Seshego last Tuesday.
This forms a part of their project-based learning curriculum as well as giving back to the community. Learners chose Dorothy Langa Primary School as their beneficiary for this year. They built a mini soccer field with sponsored tyres.
They also painted various structures around the school which included the main gate, a bathroom and the netball posts.
