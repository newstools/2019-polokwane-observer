Although Police could not indicate how long it would take to investigate a report compiled by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) on 43 alleged criminal charges involving officials of the Department of Transport and Community Safety, they gave the assurance that the report was being prioritised.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo on Tuesday indicated that the report would most probably be referred to the Hawks. “I cannot give any indication on how long it will take for us to make any arrests but we can assure everyone that the report is being prioritised and the progress thereof will be communicated,” Mojapelo said.
This after the report containing allegations of fraud and corruption by officials, including that of a prominent departmental member, was handed to acting Provincial Police Commissioner Jan Scheepers by Transport and Community Safety MEC Dickson Masemola. The identity of the official is being withheld.
Prior to handing over the report Masemola indicated that it was a referral of criminal cases emanating from a forensic investigation conducted by the SIU. The cases include alleged irregularities relating to public transport operating licences and supply chain-related matters.
“I want to take this opportunity to submit these cases as a result of work done very seriously by SIU. The investigations was centred around the following matters: allegations of fraud and corruption relating to the issuing of public transport operating licences and the procurement and repairs of government vehicles and blue lights as well as branding of vehicles,” Masemola said.
Scheepers also assured that it would be treated as priority.
