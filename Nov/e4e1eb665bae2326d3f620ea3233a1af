A joint intelligence-driven operation last week led to the arrest of two suspects, aged 29 and 32, as well as the recovery of unlicensed firearms, ammunition, a stolen motor vehicle and a number of suspected stolen items in the Mankweng and Tzaneen Clusters.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the 32-year-old suspect was arrested for house robbery by the Modjadjiskloof Police outside Tzaneen. He was traced to a hideout among a nearby bush. Further investigation led the team to three more suspects involved in this case at a house at Ga-Kgapane outside Modjadjiskloof. They however managed to escape, Mojapelo indicated.
Police found a 9 mm pistol with 48 live rounds of ammunition, a bag with a Nikon camera and a grinder, among others, in the house.
Meanwhile, Police in Mankweng traced a suspect linked to the theft of a vehicle in Botlokwa during August.
The vehicle was found and a 29-year-old suspect arrested.
A pistol and other stolen items were also confiscated.
Preliminary investigations revealed the recovered firearm to have been stolen in the Mankweng Policing area during October.
