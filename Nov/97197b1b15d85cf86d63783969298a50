The finalists of the 2019 Mr and Miss Limpopo pageant sharpened their modelling skills during rehearsals for the final show held at a hospitality establishment outside Polo­kwane on Sunday.
They were tasked to design their own dresses and suits using recycled materials and also participated in a talent show which afforded them an opportunity to showcase their dancing, singing and acting talents.
Event organiser, Zonique Saaiman said she was happy with the commitment shown by the finalists during the rehearsals. “They were eager to learn more about the pageant and they gave their all during the sessions. They were given an opportunity to make their own creations using recycled materials such as paper and plastic. With this task we wanted to see how creative they are and we are pleased with what we saw. With the talent show we wanted to instil confidence in those who are shy and those that have never performed on a bigger stage,” Saaiman said. The final event will be held at at Meropa Casino and Entertainment World on 1 December. Tickets are available from House of Asante Spa Polokwane at 29 Jorissen Street at R450 per person. “The R450 price tag includes meals and entertainment by various artists from the province,” Saaiman concluded.
