Learners and teachers from various rural schools in the province were connected through Skype to collaborate and communicate about educational matters on Friday.
This through a global activity arranged and conducted by Phuti Ragophala, multi-awarded retired educator and community developer.
According to Ragophala the programme, part of Microsoft Global Learning Connection, gave learners an opportunity to exchange ideas around culture based on food and clothing with students from various countries.
She said the learners brought along traditional food and clothes to showcase them on screen during the Skype session.
“They travelled around 10 countries virtually through Skype exchanging ideas about their culture, dancing, explaining the colours of their national flags to each other and singing national anthems of their countries to each other. Learners were totally free to express themselves on screen to their counterparts globally,” Ragophala said.
She stressed that the aim of engaging learners in the programme was to address the issue of social cohesion, coexistence, cohabitation and integration with other nationalities.
“I also wanted to reassure learners from rural schools that they too can form part of global activities as long as they have technology resources and skills to use.
Such initiatives will ensure that learners are marketable in the near future. We are preparing learners for the future because the economy of the country demands learners who are qualified in programming, coding and other Information Communication Technology related matters,” she concluded.
