The traffic control signals (UTC) for Polokwane Municipality’s rapid public transport system, known as Leeto la Polokwane, will be installed and tested along Nelson Mandela Drive tomorrow (Friday) between 08:00 and 18:00 and may affect traffic flow.
According to Spokesperson for the municipality, Thipa Selala, the newly upgraded traffic signals will contain an extra phase (bus signals) to give priority to the Leeto la Polokwane buses only. During the installation period the existing traffic signals will be switched off. “The intersections that will be affected are the Nelson Mandela Drive and Madiba Park Street intersection, the Nelson Mandela Drive and Maropeng intersection and the Nelson Mandela Drive and Zebediela Street intersection’” Selala confirmed.
“Traffic officers will be stationed at the intersections to regulate the traffic and to ensure minimum disruptions. The municipality urges motorists to obey the traffic officers during this period,” Selala said and added that the municipality would like to thank the residents of Polokwane for their patience and cooperation as they embark on the Leeto la Polokwane journey.
The final go-live date of the system is to be announced as yet.
