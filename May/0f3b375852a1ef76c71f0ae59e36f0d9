Police remain on the lookout for a suspect (29) believed to be responsible for the rape and murder of a game lodge owner outside Northam on 19 July 2014.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the female victim (58) was allegedly stabbed several times, raped and robbed of an undisclosed amount of money at the lodge. Employees discovered her corpse in a pool of blood the following day.
Police were summoned to the scene and initial investigations quickly pointed at the possible involvement of a Zimbabwean (29), by then employed by the victim, according to Ngoepe.
It is not clear at this stage whether the suspect is still in South Africa or whether he went back to Zimbabwe, according to Ngoepe. Police are calling upon Andrew Ndlovu, also known as Andrea Druza, to report to the Northam Police Station or nearest other station as he might be able to assist with investigations.
Anyone with information can contact investigating officer Kgatla on 082 565 7939 or 014 777 3573.
