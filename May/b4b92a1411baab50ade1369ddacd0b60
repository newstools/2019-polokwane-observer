Toddlers at Mitchell House’s Squirrel’s Nest not only showered their mothers with gifts but also gave them feet, hand and neck massages during Mother’s Day celebration on Friday.
The mums were firstly treated to a mouth-watering early breakfast and a mini concert. Squirrel’s Nest head, Lee Anne Petzer said mothers do so much for their kids every day that they decided to set aside special time to celebrate them. She said it was an annual gathering to appreciate mothers for their great work and added that the school would also celebrate Father’s Day.
“We are privileged as the school to be associated with such great parents and guardians. We linked Mother’s Day celebration with Slipper Day for our learners, educators and parents to wear their pyjamas. The Squirrel’s Nest caters for 125 learners in three grades being 0, 00 and 000,” Petzer explained and concluded by thanking parents, learners and educators for making the celebrations a success.
