A team of an estimated 20 officials attached to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) converged on the Office of the Premier mid-morning today (Friday) to reportedly collect evidence forming part of an investigation into international travel-related procurement.
Welcoming the visit, Premier’s spokesperson Kenny Mathivha said in a statement just released on behalf of the provincial government that the office would fully cooperate with them to ensure that “no stone is left unturned”.
“The Hawks(‘) letter of intent is aimed at investigating international travel(s) to check if there are any shenanigans. We would like to categor(icall)y put it on record that this investigation has nothing to do with Limpopo Connexion.”
After addressing the media on the sidewalk opposite the offices, Mathivha indicated that some Hawks members were still in the building at the time to continue with the investigation.
