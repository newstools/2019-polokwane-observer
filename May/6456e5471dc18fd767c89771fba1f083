The annual Spelling Bee that was hosted at Mitchell House last Wednesday saw learners from six schools in the city leaving the podium one by one until only the real fundi remained.
Grade 4 to 7 learners from Mitchell House, PEPPS, Northern Academy, Curro Heuwelkruin, Eagles Nest Christian School and Thorntree Preparatory School took part and not so often used words like humongous and hallucinogen presented a challenge while words like baboon and balloon did not confuse the young whiz kids.
In the Junior Category (Grade 4 and 5) Leyna Matthew of Northern Academy, Lilitha Ntobela of PEPPS and Selindile Ledwaba of Northern Academy occupied the first, second and third places respectively, while Ameera Gani, Mabetji Mankga and Sophie Skinner, all from Mitchell House, took the first, second and third places respectively in the Senior Category (Grade 6 and 7).
