Eight netball teams from PEPPS College and Hoër Tegniese Skool Tom Naudé (Tommies) engaged in some exciting action on court during Pietersburg Circuit Schools League matches played at PEPPS on Monday.
The league is made up of two pools of five teams each, Ubuntu for city schools and Botho for schools in Seshego and Moletjie. All eight age groups have to play all other same age teams in the group. The age groups are u.14 A and B, u.15 A and B, u.16 A and B, second and first teams.
PEPPS failed to use their home ground advantage and lost most of their matches.
The u.14As lost 6-8, the u.14Bs 3-12, u.15A 9-12, u.15B, 6-7. The u.16B, won 15-6, the u.16A lost 11-21 in a mixed team against Tommies’ second team, and drew 11-11 against the first team.
PEPPS’ mixed team consists of three male players – Seja Masipa, Ronewa Mutshila and Musa Ledwaba. The school’s netball coach, Eddie Manyathela emphasised that the three boys were doing exceptionally well. He said they were still trying to get more boys to join the sport, adding that he is also a netball player as the sport was not only meant for women.
