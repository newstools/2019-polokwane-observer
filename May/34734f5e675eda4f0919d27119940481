The drum majorettes squad of Pietersburg Comprehensive School (PCS) were the big winners of the Limpopo Majorette and Cheerleading Association’s (Limca) Day of Stars competition held at Hoër Tegniese Skool Tom Naude on Saturday.
The squad completely outshone their opponents from the Mokopane, Dixon Mphahlele, Mapudithomo and Platina primary schools to win gold certificates in the drill, flag group, no prop and baton categories with only the fifth category gold, mace group, evading them.
They will now represent the province at the South African Majorette and Cheerleading Association (Samca) competition set for 22 to 26 June in East London.
Head coach of the squad, Modikoa Mohlake said they were hoping for an even better performance at the national event. “We finished the in sixth place year. This year we want to improve our mace group routine in order for us to win the competition. We have a good squad that comprises of young, determined learners who want to win all the time. They have shown their abilities at the Day of Stars competition and I am sure they are geared to take the same performance to the national event,” Mohlake said.
