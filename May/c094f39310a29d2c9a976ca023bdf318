Water shortages were already experienced in parts of the city since today (Friday) due to maintenance work both at Ebenezer Dam and on the Dap Naude Dam supply line.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo advised last night that divers from the Department of Water Affairs commenced with emergency removal of malfunctioning hydraulic cylinders from the Ebenezer Dam, starting this morning. “This means four to five hours of pumping water to Polokwane will be lost daily until the work is finished. It is not yet clear when this process will be completed,” Mothapo said.
Mothapo also reported that the main supply line from Dap Naudé Dam was affected when a local farming company about a kilometre from the plant accidentally damaged the line when excavations were done on Thursday. “The extent of the damage is being determined and an update will be provided once a report is received. This will result in the Dalmada water treatment works being out of operation while the line is being fixed, resulting in negative impact on most of the areas,” Mothapo added.
Mothapo confirmed that the municipality will deploy water tankers in affected areas and appealed to consumers to use water sparingly.
“The municipality appreciates your patience and understanding during this difficult period,” Mothapo concluded.
