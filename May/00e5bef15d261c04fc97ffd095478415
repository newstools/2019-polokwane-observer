The Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 hosted its annual charity golf day at the Polokwane Golf Club on Thursday with 96 golfers taking on the challenge.
The team of Toyota Naboomspruit consisting of Jaco and Marco de Villiers, Lucas Otto and Quintin Prinsloo emerged as the winners and received a voucher worth R10 000 for accommodation at San Lameer for eight people, courtesy of Liebenberg Erasmus Accountants.
Organisers of the event, Orrie Baragwanath and Fred Hurter were impressed by the support received even from players from outside the city. “The event was in aid of Our Home/Ons Tuiste as well as some other charities,” Baragwanath said. Hurter extended his gratitude towards the main sponsor, BB Truck and Tractor, as well as all the other sponsors for their generous contributions.
Some of the highlights of the day were an elevated tee at the back of a truck and an opportunity to play against Ryan Chandler, one of the sponsors and paying a stiff penalty if losing.
President of the club, Johan Joubert thanked the Rotarians for their hard work before and during the event and commended the Anns for their hosting of the halfway house refreshments. “The golf day is one of our flagship fundraising events and allows the club to make a substantial contribution to Our Home/Ons Tuiste,” Joubert said.
