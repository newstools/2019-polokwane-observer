Young patients and staff members of the Cansa TLC ward at the Oncology Unit of Pietersburg Provincial Hospital celebrated Slipper Day on Friday and brightened up the day wearing colourful slippers.
Cansa Polokwane TLC Ward Coordinator Bobby Were said Slipper Day is hosted by the Reach for a Dream initiative and on the day cancer patients wearing slippers could report at any Wimpy restaurant for a complimentary cup of coffee. “Our young patients could not join in the fun and we therefore entertained them in the ward,” Were said.
Were explained that 77 dreams of children with life threatening diseases were fulfilled from April last year at the TLC ward only. The dreams included a visit to Cape Town, a group bus drive, laptops, tablets, cell phones and toys.
