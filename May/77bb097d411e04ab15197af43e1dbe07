Residents of the city will receive their municipal accounts slightly later this month due to the implementation of the revenue module of the newly acquired Munsoft software.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed that the municipality has sent out SMSes notifying the residents about the new system. “Troubleshooting and fine tuning is expected during the initial implementation stages of any new big project. It naturally requires some time to run a seamless process. The municipality has finalised the billing run and will be issuing emails and SMSes starting tonight (Monday) followed by printed statements.
Apologies are offered for the inconvenience that may be caused by the delay,” Mothapo said and added that the payment date will be 27 May as indicated on the accounts.
