Black Leopards Football Club striker Mwape Musonda was bestowed with the Premier Soccer League’s (PSL) Player of the Month Award for March and April during the PSL monthly awards held at Gauteng last Thursday.
The Zambian international scored a hat-trick in his side’s come-from-behind victory over Chippa United Footbal Club during their PSL match at Thohoyandou Stadium in March.
He then also scored in three successive matches against Bidvest Wits and Golden Arrows which were played in April period.
Musonda, the top goal scorer in the National First Division (NFD) last season, has opened a huge gap on league’s top scorers chart with 15 goals to his name.
Other players who were in contention for the award included Mxolisi Macuphu of SuperSport United and the Polokwane City pair of Mohammed Anas and George Chigova.
Musonda received R5 000 in cash prize and a floating trophy from the league.
Congratulating Musonda, club spokesperson Barry Ramunenyiwa said they were proud of his achievements and wished him all the best in the remaining matches of the league. “He has been an anchor in the team. He is one of our most consistent players and we still expect a lot from him. We also recognise the support of his teammates who have been outstanding throughout the season.”
