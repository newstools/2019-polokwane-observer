A group of South African job seekers, in continuation of a similar incident of Friday, allegedly resorted to xenophobic attacks in Potgieter Avenue this morning (Monday) claiming that foreign nationals steal their jobs and engage in horrendous criminal activities in the city and surrounds.
Sources who witnessed the incident confirmed that foreign nationals were chased away while some were beaten with dangerous objects such as knobkieries. The sources, who spoke on a condition of anonymity, emphasised that the attacks had started on Friday and added that they were tired of losing jobs to undocumented foreign nationals.
They went on to allege that employers seeking part-time workers mostly hire foreign nationals whom they claim would willingly settle for any kind of payment. The sources itemised a number of criminal acts allegedly being carried out by foreign nationals. They claimed that a male foreigner had recently raped a woman in Flora Park. They further alleged that another male foreigner, also a job seeker keeping to the area, had forged an identity document.
“These people must go back to their respective homes. They steal from us, rape our children and even kill them. We are tired of going to sleep on empty stomachs as we are unable to secure jobs because of these foreigners. The Police were at the venue in the morning but could not assist us with anything, that is why we decided to do things our own way,” they stressed.
When contacted for comment earlier today (Monday), Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe did not have information at hand on the alleged xenophobic attacks but indicated that he would conduct a follow-up.
