Limpopo’s male softball team beat KwaZulu-Natal 3-1 in their final provincial group match of Softball South Africa’s Premier League at Polokwane cricket grounds on Sunday to book a spot at the national grand finals of the league scheduled for 1 June in Cape Town.
Nkomori Chepape and Mogau Thapudi scored the winning runs in the second and the third quarter of the match.
Executive Council member of the Limpopo Softball Association, Benny Boshomane said they were pleased with the progress made by the team in the league. “They have been doing well since the league began. They won all their group matches and we are going for the league title now. We have quality players capable of winning any title in our team. We are confident that they will do well in the national finals,” he said.
Department of Sport, Arts and Culture acting head, Motlhanke Phukuntsi, said they were delighted to host the softball league matches in the province.“ Limpopo is the home of softball. It was one of the first sporting codes to amalgamate three associations that had divided players along racial lines. Such racial schisms were not adding value to this game. These were the National Softball Association from the coloured community, African Softball Association from the white community and South African Softball Federation from the black community,” Phukuntsi said during a media conference hosted by the league in Polokwane last Thursday.
