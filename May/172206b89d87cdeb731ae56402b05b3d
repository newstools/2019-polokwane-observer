A 43-year-old Police sergeant and two accomplices were expected to appear in the Musina Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week on charges of stock theft and possession of suspected stolen cattle meat. They were arrested outside the border town last week.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe could not indicate if the suspects had made their first appearance yet.
They were arrested after Police received information from community members about suspected stolen meat being off-loaded at a house in Mushenguville, a residential area on the outskirts of Musina.
Upon arrival the Police found a bakkie loaded with cattle meat parked inside the yard belonging to a Police sergeant attached to the Makhado Police Station, according to Ngoepe.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the meat was indeed of stolen stock and the three suspects were immediately arrested. The bakkie was also confiscated.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has expressed his disappointment in the involvement of the sergeant in criminal activities. He warned Police members to desist from engaging in any criminal activity as the law will equally be applied regardless of their status.
