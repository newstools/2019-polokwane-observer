Police Captain Dennis Nghunyule (55), attached to Modjadjiskloof Police Station, will remain in custody until his next court appearance in July in connection with a case of murder and attempted murder subsequent to a shooting incident at his tavern at Makosha Village outside Giyani on 19 May.
According to Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe the Giyani Magistrate’s Court declined Nghunyule’s bail application on Monday after which the case was postponed for further Police investigation to 1 July.
The appearance follows an incident during which Nghunyule reportedly had a quarrel with one of the patrons at his tavern which resulted in him allegedly producing his wife’s firearm, shooting and killing the patron instantly. When the patron’s brother interfered he was allegedly also shot but survived.
Upon hearing about the incident the community of Makosha allegedly mobilised and stormed the tavern.
They reportedly looted the liquor and other valuables before setting the building on fire. They also torched four vehicles which belonged to family members of the Police officer.
A retired Police officer who allegedly attempted to scare the crowd away by discharging his private firearm was assaulted and disarmed.
He was also admitted to hospital.
Police were called to the scene to calm the situation resulting in two Police vehicles also being damaged by the angry crowd. Police managed to arrest eight community members on charges of public violence. They were expected to appear in the same court on Tuesday.
The deceased was identified as 22-year-old Oscar Mkhabela.
