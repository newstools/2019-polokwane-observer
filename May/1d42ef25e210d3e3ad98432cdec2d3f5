Forty-six learners of Northern Academy Primary School were transported to various medical facilities in the city by medical services personnel after they were allegedly affected by a stomach bug early Tuesday morning.
Curro Holdings Head of Marketing and Communications, Mari Lategan indicated that on Tuesday the school awoke to a total of 46 learners, residing in 16 hostels across the campus, complaining about abdominal pain.
“The moment we became aware of the situation we acted in line with our processes and procedures. All parents have been informed accordingly. The area has been affected by a stomach bug since the start of winter, according to management,” Lategan said.
Medical services were called in to inspect and treat the affected learners on site. “A decision was made to take the learners to surrounding medical facilities for proper diagnosis and treatment. All of them were thoroughly checked by physicians and declared healthy and bug free with no traces of food poisoning,” Lategan said.
She concluded by saying that eight of the 46 learners appeared to have been suffering from a stomach illness. They were treated and released with the rest of the learners the same day.
