A 39-year-old man was expected to appear in the Seshego Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday after he was arrested for allegedly attempting to bribe a Police officer on Monday.
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that the suspect allegedly offered R500 to a Police officer attached to the Seshego Vehicle Identification System Unit (VIS) in order to release a suspected stolen vehicle.
The Hawks were informed and immediately set a trap for the suspect. He was arrested at the VIS premises immediately after he handed over the money to the officer.
Maluleke reiterated that a similar case was reported earlier this month when Moses Thanyani Muthelo (30) was arrested in Thohoyandou for attempting to bribe a Hawks investigator.
Muthelo allegedly offered money to the investigator in order not to oppose bail against his brother who was arrested for possession of suspected stolen motor vehicle.
Muthelo has since been released on R1 000 bail and is expected to appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court again on 24 June.
