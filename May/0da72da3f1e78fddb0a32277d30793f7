Baroka Football Club’s number one goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze and team captain Mduduzi Mdantsane will be up against Orlando Pirates’s midfielder Thembinkosi Lorch for the ultimate prize of 2018/19 Telkom Knockout Player of the Tournament at the annual Premier Soccer League (PSL) awards set for Sunday in Durban.
Chipezeze and Mdantsane were among the key players in the Baroka team that won the Telkom Knockout Trophy in December last year.
The Ga-Mphahlele based outfit won their first ever domestic cup, beating Orlando Pirates 3-2 on penalties in the final of the Telkom Knockout at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Congratulating the nominees, club spokesperson Maredi Leshilo said their nomination proves that Baroka is the best team in the league.
“They showed commitment and determination throughout the season and we are not surprised by their nomination. This is an encouragement to other players that if they work hard they will be rewarded.”
He also informed that all players had left for their respective homes on Monday and are expected to be back in June to prepare for new 2019/20 PSL season which commences in August.
