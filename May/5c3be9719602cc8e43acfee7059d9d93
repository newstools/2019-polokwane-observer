Tens of motocross enthusiasts from across the province attended Capricorn Racing Clubâ€™s (CRC) fun day hosted outside the city on Saturday.
CRC Chairperson Dean Rudiger indicated that no results were available as it was a fun day and riders used the opportunity to work on their skills for the continuous Lim MX Series hosted at various race tracks during the year.
