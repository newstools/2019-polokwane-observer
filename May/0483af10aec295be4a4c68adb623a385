A Seshego District Court prosecutor, Rhulani Guester Maboela (45) is expected to appear in court again on 21 June after she was released on R5 000 bail by the magistrateâ€™s court on Friday following her arrest on charges of corruption, extortion and defeating the ends of justice the previous day.
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that Maboela allegedly demanded a R1 500 bribe from a complainant, arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, in order to have the case against him withdrawn.
The complainant reported the matter to the Hawks who swiftly conducted an undercover operation that culminated in the arrest of the suspect at her office soon after accepting the bribe, according to Maluleke.
