A total of 201 learners of Maseala Progressive Primary School in Seshego embarked on a journey that aimed to prove that what they learn in the classroom in social sciences existed elsewhere.
This after the school’s Grades 6 and 7 learners were taken on a trip to Mapungubwe world heritage site last Thursday to learn more about the stone walls, valuables discovered in the area, the origin and meaning of Mapungubwe.
Principal Sibongile Nkomo indicated that this was an educational tour under the Social Sciences stream and that such trips are organised once a year in the second term. She further stated that they wanted to prove to learners that what they learn in theory does exist and also to broaden their subject knowledge.
The delighted group of learners was accompanied by ten educators and the school’s managing director, Gladys Mohlahlana.
