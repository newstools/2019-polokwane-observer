In an update on progress on capturing of votes in Limpopo shared during a presser at the Results Operations Centre (Roc) at Peter Mokaba Stadium this afternoon (Friday), Electoral Commission Provincial Electoral Officer (PEO) Nkaro Mateta expressed the hope that the process would be concluded by this evening.
At that stage another 25% of votes still had to be captured and verified by auditors, according to Mateta. Based on the results, voter turn-out was at around 56,32% provincially with the highest turn-out having been reported in Modimolle-Mookgophong at 62,21%, she indicated.
She informed the media that a report for a decision by the commission was being awaited with regards to investigations of prioritised matters after four objections material to the announcement of elections results as well as complaints had been received from the Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF), Agang SA and the Democratic Alliance (DA) relating to, among others, tampering with special votes and ballots, persons not being on the special votesâ€™ list seemingly having been permitted to do so, conduct of a presiding officer in relation to allowing campaigning on the day set aside for special votes, refusal for counting to take place, double voting and allegations of intimidation.
She referred to 18 cases having been recorded by the Police during this period, investigations still continuing while in some arrests had been effected and court appearances having been made by suspects in Giyani and Tzaneen. One of the cases that was alarming, she said, has stemmed from an incident of alleged assault after the partner of an IEC official showed up at a voting station demanding that she meet him while she was needed during the counting process.
