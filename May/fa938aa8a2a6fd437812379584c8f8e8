Mother’s Day celebrations abounded at local pre-schools over the last week and educators and learners left no stone unturned to make the most of the opportunity.
On Friday, young girls at Share Joy Pre-School rocked up in their mothers’ high heels and handbags to celebrate those very special people in their lives. The learners had all designed greeting cards which they presented to their mothers. Since the educators at the school are also mothers, they were also acknowledged for their effort and commitment towards shaping their charges’ futures. Learners were also given opportunities to tell their fellow learners about their mothers.
Learners at Little Bright Stars Crèche and Pre-School observed Mother’s Day on Monday.
The school gave each learner a Mother’s Day cup full of great little gifts to present to their mothers as tokens of appreciation and to convey their love for them.
