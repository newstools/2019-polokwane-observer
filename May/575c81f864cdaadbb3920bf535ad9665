He previously coached Gor Mahia Football Club in Kenya and Simba Football Club in Tanzania. Club spokesperson, Berry Ramunenyiwa said Kerr resigned last week but could not divulge the reasons behind his resignation. “We received a resignation letter from him last week. We can confirm that he resigned but unfortunately we cannot comment further on the matter because we are still on holiday.
It is off season and our offices are closed. We will open on 10 July and we will release a statement then.”
