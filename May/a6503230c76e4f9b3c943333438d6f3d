In giving rise to their threats to boycott the national general elections, the Pro-Makhado Demarcation Task Team and residents in Vuwani this morning (Tuesday) resorted to a total shut-down of services in the area ahead of the mass meeting scheduled for today at the stadium.
This morning Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo highlighted that security was tight in Vuwani to ensure that there no violent protest takes place. He reiterated that the Police presence was also to ensure the safety of those who want to vote tomorrow.
Although it was reported that residents in some villages in Vuwani went to cast special votes yesterday (Monday), the task team’s deputy chairperson Arnold Mulaudzi claimed villages that are likely to vote are Tsonga dominated as they did in 2016. He further said only people who want to be serviced by Collins Chabane Local Municipality are likely to vote.
Mulaudzi indicated that no schools would be opened for voting, adding they were expecting to be addressed by a senior government official at the mass meeting. He also confirmed the total shut-down of services in the area.
