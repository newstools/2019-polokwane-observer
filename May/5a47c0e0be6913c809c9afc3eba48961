Motorists were taken by surprise when noticing workers from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure busy converting the dangerous junction between the N1 and the Soetdorings turn-off into a three-way stop yesterday (Wednesday).
Quite a number of accidents occurred at the junction over the last years and a passing motorist applauded the initiative of the authorities and reckoned that the intervention would make a difference.
For the time being motorists approaching the junction from Soetdorings are advised to ensure that traffic on the N1 have actually come to a standstill before they enter the intersection. Warnings on the road surface as well as rumble strips were under construction when the site was visited on Wednesday.
