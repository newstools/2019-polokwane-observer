Rising soccer star Kgaugelo Sekgota has been included in the Bafana Bafana squad that will participate in the upcoming 19th edition of the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) Cup Tournament scheduled for 2 to 8 June at Princes Magogo Stadium in Durban.
The former Polokwane United Football Club striker from Makgofe outside Seshego currently plies his trade with Vitória Setúbal Football Club in Portugal. He will get his first international cap at the tournament.
The 21-year old said he was delighted to be called up for the national team and is looking forward to make good use of the opportunity. “It is a dream come true to receive a national call-up. It is a dream of every soccer player and I am grateful to be part of the team. I am looking forward to meet other players in the national team. I hope to contribute to the national team’s success and eventually win the tournament,” Sekgota said.
His former coach and mentor, Bally Smart said he was proud of Sekgota’s achievement. “He is a disciplined soccer player, focused and hard-working. It is a great achievement for him and I have no doubt he will contribute to the success of the national team.”
