Baroka Football Club caused a major upset in football circles when they beat Amazulu Football Club 1-0 in their 27th match of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
The achievement sees the Ga-Mphahlele based gallery moving from 14th to 12th position of the league.
With only two matches before the league season closes, Baroka could see themselves in the top 8 bracket provided they win their remaining matches.
They will face title contenders Bidvest Wits on Saturday at Milpark Stadium and host the relegation threatened Maritzburg United at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 11 May.
Club spokesperson Mogau Maredi said they were pleased to move out of the relegation zone but did not rule out the possibility of a top 8 spot. “The top eight spot is possible, but our focus is to move out of the relegation zone completely. We are left with two difficult matches. Both clubs are fighting different battles, Wits wants the league title and Maritzburg wants to avoid relegation. It is going to be tough. This was one of our best seasons in the league, we won the Telkomknockout Cup and we want to finish the league on a high note as well. What we can promise our fans and supporters is that we will fight and get six points from those remaining matches,”Maredi said.
