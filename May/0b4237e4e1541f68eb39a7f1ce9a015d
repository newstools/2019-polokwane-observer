Junior athletes from six schools in the city participated in a mini soccer and netball day at Mitchell House last Saturday.
The players from Mitchell House, Bet Shalom Christian School, Elica Primary School, Northview Christian Academy, PEMPS and PEPPS were enthusiastically supported by parents and fellow learners as they gave it their best. Mitchell House Director of Sport Fred Romijn thanked the schools which participated. “It is always a pleasure seeing the enthusiasm of each and every child when on the field or court, especially at that young age. Well done to all the netball and soccer players,” Romijn said.
Mitchell House Director of Communications Achsah Phoshoko said that no results were kept. “It was a fun festival where every child received a certificate of participation,” according to Phoshoko.
