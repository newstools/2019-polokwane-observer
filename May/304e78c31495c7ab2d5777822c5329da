Seven suspects were expected to appear in the Mokerong Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week after they were arrested in Mahwelereng outside Mokopane in connection with stock theft last Thursday.
According to Maphure Manamela of the Provincial Police Communications Centre, Police received a tip-off from the farming community on unknown men herding cattle along the N11 and a suspicious Volkswagen Golf roaming the area.
Three of the suspects were cornered along the gravel road from Ga-Mashashane leading to the N11 between Ga-Molekane and Ga-Magongwa village outside Mahwelereng while herding 12 cattle on foot. Their accomplices who were driving in the Volkswagen without registration numbers were arrested not far from the scene.
The origin of the cattle are still being investigated.
The suspects may be linked to other stock theft cases within the province, according to Manamela.
