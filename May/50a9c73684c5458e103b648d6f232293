Police are investigating an incident that led to the death of a three-year-old toddler who was allegedly attacked by dogs at a tavern in Zone 1, Mahwelereng outside Mokopane on Saturday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that Police are considering charging the victim’s 36-year-old mother for child neglect after she apparently took the child along on a visit to the tavern.
It is alleged that, upon her arrival at the tavern, she put the child down on a bed in a back room of the tavern before going inside. It is suspected that the child woke up and wandered into the backyard of the tavern where she was attacked by an unknown number of dogs.
One of the patrons apparently heard the commotion and ran to the girl’s rescue.
She was taken to a local hospital where she was certified dead on arrival, Ngoepe reported.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba condemned the incident and cautioned parents to put their children’s safety first. “Taking a child to the liquor outlet is totally uncalled for,” Ledwaba reportedly said.
