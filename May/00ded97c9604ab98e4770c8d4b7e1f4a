Four voting stations in Vuwani that were forced to close due to unrest and safety concerns for a period during the course of the day are reportedly operating again.
In a statement forwarded from its national results operations centre in Tshwane late afternoon, the Electoral Commission said the stations were open again.
It called on registered voters who havenâ€™t yet gone to vote to make use of the final hours of voting to make their voices heard.
