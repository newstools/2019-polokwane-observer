Tshepo Metle (35) was sentenced to eight years for conspiracy to commit armed robbery, three for possession of an unlicensed firearm and six months for possession of unlicensed ammunition.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe referred to an incident in Tzaneen in December 2016 when the five, in a black Mercedes-Benz, came across a security guard riding a bicycle. They stopped him, pretending to ask for directions when one of them suddenly shot the security guard. They had tried to load the victim into the car but failed, then took his firearm and drove-off. A passing motorist took him to a local hospital where he died. On the same day Police received a tip-off about a planned armed robbery in the area. The Provincial Tracking Team intercepted them along the Tzaneen/Letaba road but the suspects gave chase and started shooting at the Police who retaliated until the driver of the Mercedes-Benz lost control and collided with a fence. All five were arrested on the scene.
