With only six days left before the national general elections, political parties are going all out to win people’s votes.
The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo conducted a morning blitz at Savannah Mall and Mall of the North early morning (Thursday). Party provincial leaders and supporters convened at a parking lot opposite Jack Botes Hall before proceeding to the two venues to hand out T-shirts and encourage people to vote for the movement.

ANC provincial head of elections, Basikopo Makamu indicated that they initially wanted five teams visiting the malls but had eventually decided on two. He cautioned that members should not just dish out T-shirts but have a chat with shoppers and encourage them to vote for the ANC next Wednesday. After the blitz, the ANC Provincial Election Team (PET) was anticipated to meet for the last time before the elections.
