Road Hogs Pietersburg Bike Club handed over 64 boxes of Easter eggs to various charitable organisations in the city on Saturday.
“This is our annual event aimed at touching the lives of the less fortunate and needy. We wanted them to feel the essence of Easter. Eighty-one bikers participated on the day and we managed to deliver all the eggs. It was a huge success. We thank our members for their involvement. They contributed most of the eggs and we appreciate their kindness,” club President Ronald Leach said.
