The Limpopo Baobabs started their 2019 National Netball League campaign on a good note by defeating Mpumalanga Sunbirds 53-51 during their opening match of the league at Pretoria University Sports Centre on Saturday.
Baobabs who have never won the league title before showed more determination in all four quarters of the match to win the duel.
Head coach Anna Ledwaba said the victory against Sunbirds set a good tone for them in the league. “We needed a good start in the league. We are pleased with the victory and I think it will boast our morale ahead of the other matches in the league,” she said.
The team will be hoping for maximum points against Eastern Cape Aloes and Northern Cape Diamonds whom they face in their group matches scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) and Sunday at Pretoria University Sports Centre.
“We have to win those matches in order to move to the next round. Both teams are tough opponents but our girls showed in the opening match of the league that they are ready to compete and fight for the league title. We hope our local followers will make their way to Pretoria to come and support us,” she said.
