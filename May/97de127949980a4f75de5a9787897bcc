Two persons lost their lives after an ambulance in which they were transported was involved in a motor vehicle accident in the city in the early hours on Saturday.
A statement issued by Department of Health spokesperson Neil Shikwambana indicated that the two were being transported from Lebowa­k­gomo Hospital to Pietersburg Provincial Hospital. The ambulance collided with a vehicle that allegedly travelled at a high speed and failed to stop at a traffic light at the corner of Grobler and Biccard Streets in the CBD. One patient died on impact, while the other, as well as the emergency medical service crew, was critically injured.
Shikwambana said the second patient later succumbed to injuries in hospital. Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba reportedly expressed sadness over the news. “As a department, we are saddened by the fact that these patients met their untimely death while en-route to receive treatment in order to improve their state of personal health. We send our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and wish a speedy recovery to those who sustained injuries during the accident,” a statement issued by the department read.
